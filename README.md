# Zipf's Law

A quick demonstration of Zipf's law. Inspired by this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05055), I just wanted to see it for myself on random sources of data. It's well known that natural language follows a Zipfian power distribution of alpha ~ 1.0. I tried two Wikipedia articles and four books, all resulting in alpha values ranging from 0.9 and 1.0.
