                              INTRODUCTION


Universally known as a land of untold antiquity, of fascinating romance
and marvellous traditions, Peru may be considered, from the standpoint
of history, the most interesting of all the South American countries.
The revelations of scientific research are daily adding to the record of
its glory in the remote past, when the Incas and their predecessors
ruled with theocratic sway over a large part of the continent and lived
in barbaric splendor at Cuzco, at Chan-Chan, or at some other of the
great pre-Columbian capitals, the ruins of which to-day excite the
admiration of archæologists and the enthusiasm of sightseers. The
literature of the country, also, is constantly revealing new phases of
the national life as it existed in ancient times, and especially in the
more recent period of the Spanish viceroyalty. Unlimited wealth, easily
acquired through the labor of the conquered race in the rich mines of
the sierra during colonial days, led to the greatest extravagance,
though at the same time it provided ample means for travel and study,
the benefits of which became apparent in the fine culture of the
people—a culture which has left its impress on succeeding generations of
Peruvians, giving them the reputation they enjoy to-day of being
essentially a gentle and polished nation.

But, although scientific investigation and literary skill have added
much within recent years to what was already more or less generally
known about Peru, and the land of the Incas and the viceroys has been
made a more charming subject than ever before as regards its antiquity
and romance, yet the Peru of to-day, the real Peru, has received
comparatively little attention from writers and travellers, and is still
almost an unknown country to the average reader. The purpose of the
present volume is to present a passing glimpse of the Old Peru—the whole
story of which can only be told in many volumes—and to give a faithful
description of the progress and development that are evident in every
feature of the national life as reflected in the social, political,
industrial, and commercial institutions of the New Peru. The prosperous
future of Peru is assured by the patriotism, energy, and enterprise that
are apparent in every feature of the national life, and it is certain
that the present century will see the wealth and greatness of the
country increased beyond anything dreamed of in the days of the Incas
and the viceroys. The spirit that won the national independence and
successfully established republican institutions lives to-day, and is
working for the ascendancy of the noblest ideals of the race.

In the preparation of this work, I found that the knowledge I had
previously gained through close association with the people of Latin
America during more than fifteen years’ journeying in these countries
was of the greatest advantage. Travelling in Peru was more like visiting
among friends than studying the manners and customs of a foreign people,
and the uniform kindness and hospitality everywhere shown me made my
experience in this beautiful land one of constant pleasure and of
enduring memory. I sincerely appreciate the great assistance rendered me
in securing information from government sources, from the public
libraries and from many kind friends in every part of Peru, and I take
this opportunity of expressing my thanks, from my heart. It is
impossible to live in Peru without learning to love the country and its
people, and while I have tried to allow no partiality to influence my
judgment in writing this book, I cannot do otherwise than present to the
reader what I found most interesting in my own study of the Old and the
New Peru.

                   ANCIENT PERU—PRE-INCAIC MONUMENTS


[Illustration: GIRDLE FOUND IN THE CEMETERY OF PACHACÁMAC.]

The historian of the Conquerors who described the newly discovered Peru
as “the Ophir of the Occident” gave it a name which modern research
proves to have been singularly appropriate. Not only in wealth, but in
antiquity, this interesting country is comparable to the fabled land of
the East from which the emissaries of King Solomon brought so many
luxuries to please the taste of their royal master. There are eminent
writers and students of the records of ancient times who are of the
opinion that the famous Ophir of the Bible was no other than ancient
Peru, and that the Phœnicians—those intrepid navigators of past
ages—visited its shores and were the founders of its earliest
civilization.

But speculation as to the origin of the ancient Peruvians covers such an
extensive field that almost every writer on the subject has a distinct
opinion; and every nation of the Orient has been supposed, by one
authority or another, to have laid the foundation of Peruvian culture.
The most popular theory gives to China the credit of introducing the
earliest civilization on the American continent; and in support of this
belief many parallels are drawn between the Mongolians and the primitive
races of the New World in their traditions, customs, and, particularly,
the similarity of their features. In some parts of the coast district of
Peru, the indigenes do not speak Quichua, as do the descendants of the
Incas’ people, but have a language which is said to be easily understood
by the Chinese; and there is, apparently, a close analogy between the
ancient creeds of the coast Indians and Chinese worship. According to
several authorities, the traditional heroes of Peruvian and Mexican
civilization were Buddhist priests. In this connection it is worthy of
mention that some of the _huacas_ which have been taken from ancient
cemeteries on the coast, bear a marked resemblance to the well-known
idols of Buddhist worship. The name _huaca_ is given to all consecrated
relics in these ancient burials, including the corpse and its wrappings,
as well as the innumerable articles of household and personal use,
ornaments and food, interred therewith. The custom of placing maize and
other edibles in the grave, and (as has been found in some cases) of
putting a coin in the mouth of the deceased, affords proof that these
ancients believed in a future life. Most of the interments were made in
huge mounds, called _huacas_, built of sun-dried bricks, or, in the
earliest periods, of round balls of mud.

From whatever source Peru derived its earliest culture, everything
indicates that at some period, probably at various times during the
early ages, immigrants arrived in the country from Asiatic shores. The
most eminent authorities, among them the Peruvian scholars Dr. Pablo
Patron, Dr. Larrabure y Unanue, and others who have made a scientific
study of the antiquity of their country, agree in the belief that there
were several early immigrations to Peru from China and Japan. A few even
accept the theory that the origin of the advanced races who first
peopled the ancient world of the West is to be traced to a lost
“Atlantis” and a submerged “Lemuria,” supposed to have been great
continents in a past age, whose inhabitants, rivalling the ancient
Egyptians in culture, lived in close communication with America, and
gave it the basis of its earliest civilization. Conservative scholars
are disposed to give little attention to purely speculative theories,
and prefer to seek the solution of the problem by the most practical
methods.

It is to the honor of Peru that the government, recognizing the
importance of exploring its great treasure-store of antiquities in the
interest of modern knowledge, is directing a systematic effort to
penetrate the veil of mystery which envelopes the remote past of the
country and its people. Dr. Max Uhle, an eminent authority on Peruvian
archæology, is now occupied in the work of excavating and classifying
Peruvian antiquities in accordance with modern scientific methods. The
facts so far accumulated from reliable archæological data point to an
antiquity of at least three thousand years, and may indicate a much more
remote period of culture.

[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE PRINCIPAL PALACE OF PACHACÁMAC.]

Long ages before the New World was discovered by Europeans, and
centuries before the Incas established their wonderful empire, Peru was
the home of a mighty race, or of successive races, whose dominion
extended at some time over a great part of tropical America. The records
of their advancement still exist in the stupendous ruins of their sacred
temples and in the objects of art and evidences of culture found in
their burial mounds.

Like the various nations of the Orient, these ancients of the New World
had their ambitious struggles for supremacy one against another, their
periods of great prosperity and power,—sometimes arriving at the height
of despotic rule over all contemporaries,—and their time of decline
before the ascendancy of a more potent rival. The record of changes
wrought in successive periods, and of influences resulting from
communication between the inhabitants of widely separated regions, is
written in their monuments and in the huacas of their cemeteries, and
furnishes the key to the chronology of prehistoric Peru, possibly to all
American antiquity.

[Illustration: THE EASTERN STREET OF PACHACÁMAC.]

Interesting ruins abound in every part of Peru, from the environs of the
capital to the most remote districts of the frontier. Within a few
hours’ ride of Lima are situated the ancient necropolis of Ancón and the
temple of Pachacámac, where recent excavations have brought to light
many interesting prehistoric relics. In no other land do the same
conditions exist as in Peru, where the archæologist has advantages in
the pursuit of his investigations which the countries of the ancient
Egyptians, Babylonians, and Greeks do not afford. Here it is possible to
study, at first hand, many of the customs that prevailed long before the
advent of the Spaniards, as they are still practised in the sierra,
where the same feast days have been observed from time immemorial, the
same methods of spinning and weaving are followed to-day as in
prehistoric ages, the picturesque and brilliantly colored costumes of
their ancestors are yet in vogue among the indigenes, and even a few of
the wonderful dyes, which excel in permanence those of the best European
markets, are made to-day by these children of an ancient race, as they
were by their forefathers in centuries past.

The most ancient civilization in Peru of which traces have been found up
to the present time was developed in the coast region, around Nasca and
Ica in the southern district and near Trujillo in the north; and the
traveller whose interest in antiquities induces him to pay a visit to
this country can see some of the most remarkable ruins on the American
continent without the inconvenience of making a long and fatiguing
overland journey, as the ocean steamers of the South Pacific call at
ports in the immediate neighborhood of extensive ruins of prehistoric
cities. Along the coast may also be seen shell mounds and other
fragments of a primitive age, showing that in a very remote period the
inhabitants subsisted almost entirely on sea food; though nothing has
been found to indicate that these people were in any way related to the
races that attained, at a later date, such a high degree of culture as
that represented in the monuments, potteries, and particularly in the
textiles, of Nasca, Pachacámac, and Trujillo. The textiles of ancient
Peru are marvellous in quality, design, and coloring, and are the
especial delight and admiration of the archæologist.

[Illustration: A VIEW OF THE SUN TEMPLE OF PACHACÁMAC, SHOWING NICHED
WALLS.]

Pachacámac, situated about twenty-five miles south of Lima, in the
valley of Lurin, overlooking the sea, is, in some respects, the most
interesting prehistoric monument of Peru. Nearly all travellers who
visit Lima spend a day among these crumbling walls and burial mounds.
The first part of the journey to Pachacámac lies across the Rimac
valley, which is itself famous in ancient legends as the site of a
wonderful temple dedicated to the oracle “Rimac,” the name signifying
“one who speaks.” The remains of this great edifice—once almost as
celebrated for splendor and riches as that of Pachacámac—are still to be
seen just outside of Lima. Between the valleys of Rimac and Lurin, a
desert waste of sand extends, known as the Tablada de Lurin; it is a
welcome relief when this part of the ride is over and the green meadows
of Lurin appear in view, though even the desert has its unspeakable
charm. Several hills rise two or three hundred feet above the level of
the desert, and among these hills the ancient city of Pachacámac was
located. The area within the outer walls that enclose the ruins measures
nearly three miles in length by two in breadth, the chief interest being
centred in the space occupied by the walls of the temple erected to the
god Pachacámac. It was while excavating in these ruins a few years ago
that Dr. Uhle made the discoveries which laid the foundation for a new
classification of Peruvian antiquities, in accordance with the evidences
of successive periods of culture. Previous to that time, all the objects
taken from Peruvian cemeteries and placed on exhibition in the museums
of Europe and North America, were arranged in a manner to give the
impression that they represented various phases of one continuous period
of culture. Carved monoliths, mummies, and vessels of gold, silver, and
pottery, were disposed of with no more definite clue to their origin
than was afforded by a statement of the locality from which they had
been taken and the circumstances and date of their excavation. A
scientific exploration of the ruins of Pachacámac has revealed the fact
that its great temple outlasted several successive ages of culture, and
that its other edifices were constructed at later periods, the Incas
having built a Temple of the Sun and a convent for the Virgins of the
Sun close to the ancient shrine of Pachacámac, whose name signifies “The
Creator of the World.” The temple of the “Creator God” has undergone
many changes. Excavations show that the original edifice was destroyed
long centuries ago, whether by earthquake or in a mighty conflict with a
rival people is not known, and that a cemetery at its base was buried in
the débris. A larger temple was afterward erected on the same site,
immediately over the earlier edifice, the terraces of the later
structure covering the débris under which the older cemetery was
located. The burial place of the larger temple, as well as that of the
original building, was found to be filled with graves, the worshippers
of Pachacámac having come to this shrine as the Mohammedans flocked to
Mecca centuries later, feeling that they had gained the greatest of all
blessings if they could but be buried within the sacred city. It is
estimated that thirty thousand of the faithful were interred in the
cemetery of Pachacámac. An examination of the _huacas_ found in the
various strata of these ruins shows the influence of five separate
periods on the culture of this region, and has enabled the archæologist
to determine the antiquity of Pachacámac relative to that of other
ancient ruins, such as those of Tiahuanaco in Bolivia and the more
recent edifices of Incaic origin. It is regarded as certain that the
oldest temple of Pachacámac represents an earlier period than does
Tiahuanaco, though the latter antedates by many centuries the monuments
of Inca civilization. The art displayed in the shape and design of some
of the vessels taken from the cemetery of Pachacámac bears a
resemblance, in the earlier period, to that seen in the _huacas_ of
Tiahuanaco, and, in its latest expression, to the art of the Incaic
civilization; this would seem to indicate that at least three successive
cultures dominated the whole of ancient Peru, with long periods of
transition intervening, when the country was divided and governed by
numerous races of more or less advanced culture.

[Illustration: PRE-INCAIC POTTERY FROM PACHACÁMAC.]

Why did the ancient Peruvians choose, as the site of one of their
greatest temples, a strip of arid plain, when a vast region lay before
them, presenting every variety of blessing which a bountiful Nature and
beneficent Providence could bestow upon a favored land? This question is
suggested not only as one contemplates the ruins of Pachacámac, but also
in the presence of the temple and monoliths of Tiahuanaco. Was it that
fear was the directing impulse, and a desire to propitiate an evil deity
was stronger than the inspiration to adore a beneficent and beloved
creator? In a land of snow-capped mountains, unfathomable cañons, and
varied climate, where stupendous evidences of an omnipotent power were
constantly present to impress the imagination of a primitive people, and
the changes wrought by Nature were sometimes sudden and disastrous, as
in the case of earthquakes and tidal waves, it is not strange that, as
is seen in India, where similar conditions prevailed, the dawning
intelligence of a primitive race was apparently dominated by fear rather
than love in the exercise of its religion. An explanation of the choice
of locality for the temple of Pachacámac is afforded by the following
legend, the origin of which is said to be very ancient. The
distinguished author of the archæological treatise _Pachacámac_ relates
the story: “In the beginning of the world there was no food for a man
and a woman whom the god Pachacámac had created. The man starved, but
the woman survived. One day, as she was searching among the thorn bushes
for roots with which to stay her hunger, she lifted up her eyes to the
sun and with tears and lamentation cried: ‘Beloved Creator of all
things! Why hast thou brought me into the light of this world if I am to
die of hunger and want? Oh, that thou hadst not created me out of
nothing, or hadst suffered me to die immediately on entering the world,
instead of leaving me alone in it without children to succeed me, poor,
cast down, and sorrowful! Why, O Sun, having created us, why wilt thou
let us perish? And if thou art the Giver of Light, why art thou so
niggardly as to refuse me my nourishment? Thou hast no pity and heedst
not the sorrow of those whom thou hast created only to their misery.
Cause heaven to slay me with lightning or earth to swallow me, or give
me food, for thou, Almighty One, hast made me!’ The sun, touched with
pity, descended to her and bade her give up her fears and hope for
comfort, for she would soon be delivered from the cause of her trouble.
One day, while she was wearily searching for roots, she became
impregnated with his rays and bore a son after four days. But
Pachacámac, who was the son of the Sun, was angry with the woman for
having worshipped his father and for having borne him a son in defiance
of himself; he seized the newborn demigod and cut him to pieces. In
order, however, that the woman should not suffer for lack of food, he
sowed the dismembered parts of the boy, and the harvest was a bountiful
one; from the teeth grew corn; from the ribs and bones sprang the yucca
and other roots; from the flesh appeared vegetables and fruits. Since
that time, men have known no more want, and they owe this abundance of
food to Pachacámac. But the mother mourned for her child and appealed
again to the Sun. Again the Sun was moved to pity and he commanded her
to bring him the umbilical cord of the murdered child; into it he put
life, and gave her another son, whom she called Wichama, who grew strong
and powerful and, when a young man, set out to travel like his father,
the Sun. But as soon as Wichama left his mother, Pachacámac slew her and
caused the birds to devour her, all but the hair and bones, which he
concealed near the shore. Then Pachacámac created men and women who were
to take possession of the earth, and he set up Curacas and Caciques to
rule over them. But when Wichama, returning, found that his mother had
been slain, he was in a terrible rage, and commanded her bones to be
brought to him; these he joined together and he brought her back to
life. The two then planned revenge against Pachacámac, who, rather than
struggle with his second brother, threw himself into the sea from the
spot where his temple now stands. When Wichama saw his enemy escape from
him, he was in a fury of rage and with the breath of his nostrils he set
fire to the air and scorched the fields. He accused the inhabitants of
having aided Pachacámac and besought his father to turn them to stone.
His request was granted, but both the Sun and Wichama repented of this
terrible deed, and caused the petrified Curacas and Caciques to be set
up and worshipped, some on the shore and others in the sea, where they
still stand as rocks and reefs.” The same authority interprets the story
as a myth of the Seasons, describing the phenomena of nature, as
annually repeated in the climate of the coast land. The description of
climatic conditions shows, as the most characteristic feature, the
annually repeated struggle of the vegetation of the valley, which
depends entirely on artificial irrigation, against the scorching heat of
the sun. The former is personified in the god Pachacámac. The Sun, with
whom Pachacámac carries on his struggle, represents the solar year; the
first solar son, whom Pachacámac kills, represents possibly the spring
sun before the rising of the highland rivers, when the season of
fruitfulness begins; the scattering of the teeth and bones of the
murdered son produces the fertility of the soil. The woman who bears a
son to the Sun god is the year; from a needy but toil-free life in the
wilderness, Pachacámac leads her to a life of care and toil, such as
cultivation of the fields requires; still grieving over the death of her
first son, she is given Wichama, the autumn and winter Sun, with whom
Pachacámac enters into a struggle. The woman grows old as does the year;
Pachacámac kills her—as the year ends with the harvest. After the
ingathering of the harvest and the autumnal decrease of the rivers,
Pachacámac is unable to resume the struggle; his flight into the ocean
to escape Wichama corresponds to the protecting cover of dense fogs
which every winter overspread the parched fields. The Sun hero wreaks
his vengeance on the fields of the fog region which even in winter are
exposed to the arid sun.

[Illustration: CURIOUS SYMBOLS OF PACHACÁMAC WORSHIP.]

[Illustration: FAÇADE OF THE PALACE OF CHAN-CHAN, NEAR TRUJILLO.]

Mythical legends are related of three principal deities that were
worshipped by the ancient Peruvians. Of these, an important place is
given to the great god Con, who, according to tradition, was invisible,
possessing “no bones, nerves, or extremities,” and who “travelled with
the swiftness of spirits.” He levelled the sierras, filled up the
cañons, and covered the earth with fruits and everything necessary for
the sustenance of men and women, so that they might enjoy abundance.
But, unappreciative of their blessings, the people of the coast gave
themselves up to all manner of evil and forgot their benefactor. Con,
indignant over their corruption, transformed them into black cats and
other ill-favored animals, denied them the blessing of rain, and changed
their happy and fruitful land into an arid desert. According to the same
legend, Pachacámac, restored fertility to the earth and created a new
race of men, the ancestors of the present Indians. Besides Con and
Pachacámac, there was also the mighty Viracocha, the god of the deluge,
who rose from the waters of Lake Titicaca, made the heavens and the
earth, and, before creating the light of day, peopled the earth with its
first inhabitants. These were afterward changed to stone because of
their disobedience; but in order that the darkness should disappear and
Peru be peopled, Viracocha appeared again—this time with followers—and
created the sun and the stars and formed models of the future Peruvians;
the images, representing men, women, and children, he distributed
throughout the different provinces. He then sent his followers to the
different regions to animate these models, which was done by the
invocation, “Arise and people this earth, which is barren and solitary!
Thus commands Viracocha, who is the creator of the world!” In response
to these words the images became possessed of life and appeared on the
mountains, in the valleys, beside the rivers, everywhere. A few beings,
created to fulfil a special destiny, were animated by Viracocha himself,
and as soon as they recognized their creator, they erected a temple of
worship in his honor. The Spanish historian, Sebastian Lorente, who
relates the legends of Con, Pachacámac, and Viracocha in his interesting
and valuable work on Peru, impressed by the evident relation existing
between the three great deities, infers that in ancient Peru there were
three principal centres of population and culture,—the coast, the
sierra, and the Titicaca plateau. These centres did not arrive at the
height of their power contemporaneously, nor were they necessarily
related to one another, though the influence of each one is seen, in
some degree, in the development of all three. A distinct, and
undoubtedly a very ancient, architecture prevails in the temples,
palaces, and pyramids of the coast, unidentified either with that of the
interior valleys or of the high plateau. The magnificent ruins of Chimu
culture, as seen in the great walls of Chan-Chan, which measure from
twenty to thirty feet in height, and show wonderful designs and stucco
work on their surface, as well as the monuments of an earlier people, as
seen at Huaca del Sol, near Moche, and the temple Pachacámac, are of a
different character from the edifices of Huánuco Viejo in the sierra, of
Sacsahuaman at Cuzco, and of the pillars and round tower (Pelasgian
style) in Puno; while these latter ruins bear little relation in
construction to the cyclopean edifices of Tiahuanaco, in Bolivia, the
centre of what is sometimes called the Aymará culture.

[Illustration: CARVED TERRACES OF THE PALACE OF CHAN-CHAN.]

[Illustration: ANIMAL CARVINGS ON THE WALLS OF CHAN-CHAN.]

Aside from their scientific importance, the antiquities of Peru are
interesting to travellers because they have many features that appeal to
one’s imagination and love of mystery. They lie out of the beaten track
of the sightseer, who journeys annually, guide-book in hand, to gaze on
the ruins of their Egyptian and Pelasgian contemporaries in the Old
World. But they possess the greater fascination of the unsolved problem,
made doubly attractive by apparently innumerable “clues,” which
stimulate the imagination and tempt one to construct independent
theories as to their origin and antiquity. Karnak and the Pyramids may
be no more ancient than Nasca; certainly the Sphinx is not nearly so
great an enigma as are the _huacas_ of Trujillo and Ancón cemeteries;
and there is nothing in Oriental antiquities that quite resembles the
mummies taken out of one of these mysterious burial mounds.

[Illustration: RUINS OF CHAN-CHAN.]

The method of preparing the ancient Peruvian corpse for burial was
unique, though it cannot be couriered artistic, as, at first sight, the
_huaca_ looks like a large sack well filled and bound around with a
network of ropes. The process of unwrapping, which is a long one,
reveals the corpse in a sitting posture, with the arms clasping the
knees and the head bent over. Sometimes the swathings are of finely
woven vicuña cloth, and ornaments of gold and silver are hung on the
corpse, beautiful and costly vases and various other articles of value
being placed beside it. From a study of these articles it has been
possible to learn, to some extent, what the mode of life was among these
ancient people, and many of the _huacas_ have furnished data of the
greatest importance. Fine textiles, woven in curious designs, are found
in most of the cemeteries; but in those of greatest antiquity no
textiles appear, and this fact affords a clue to their great age also,
as buried textiles have been found to outlast periods of fifteen hundred
years. The nitrous nature of the soil in which these burials have taken
place accounts for the wonderful preservation of the mummies, which are
really desiccated corpses. The burial of the poor was a simple ceremony
and in some cases consisted merely in depositing the corpse in a grave
in the sand; though, always, the treasures of the departed were placed
beside them, and it is not unusual to find tools, household utensils,
and articles of personal adornment scattered over the arid fields. The
great plain of Chimu, near Trujillo, which covers a territory twelve
miles long by six miles broad on the northern bank of the Moche River,
and which was so rich in buried treasure when the Spaniards first began
to plunder its temple, palaces, and burial ground, that the king’s fifth
of the gold taken out amounted, in 1576, to ten thousand ounces, is
literally strewn with human skulls, pieces of pottery, and other
_huacas_. The cemetery of Ancón has apparently inexhaustible treasures,
and excursion parties seldom return to Lima after a visit to its graves
without bringing trophies of their outing in the form of prehistoric
relics.

[Illustration: MORTUARY CLOTH WITH SYMBOLIC EMBLEMS.]

The contemplation of the ancient ruins of Peru stirs the imagination and
brings before the mental vision pictures of these people of a forgotten
past, with many fanciful ideas of their appearance and their origin, of
the lives they led, the religion they practised, and the predominating
social features of their civilization. Were they “a white and bearded
race” as some of the legends tell? Or did the natives emerge out of
barbarism and advance in culture, at first, unaided by outside
influences? Were the conditions in ancient Peru as favorable for the
evolution of human culture as those of ancient India and Egypt? One
would like to know, in reference to the ancient edifices, whose
crumbling ruins are still wonderful after the lapse of ages, who built
them, and what the elaborate picture writings on their walls mean to
tell us. It is said that the pre-Incaic people used hieroglyphics, but
that the knowledge of this art was lost or prohibited by the Incas.
Their civilization also gives evidence, in the ornamented pottery, the
carvings of intricate design, and the fine workmanship of their gold and
silver vessels, that its art surpassed, in technique and imagination,
the productions of later prehistoric periods. In the earliest ages two
closely related civilizations existed in the coast region of Peru, one
of them centred around Trujillo and the other in the vicinity of Nasca
and Ica, and, fine as they were, there is nothing similar to them in
later cultures. The southern form is especially notable for the
perfection of shape and decoration of its pottery, the freedom and
breadth of its style; while the northern form is more distinguished by
the harmony and greatness of its development. Gold, silver, and copper
abounded and were wrought into manifold shapes; gold was cast and
chased, soldered with copper and silver, or used as plating over copper
and inlaid with turquoises; mosaic was also known. This culture was
followed by that of the Tiahuanaco, which in the course of centuries
declined and was forgotten, until the appearance of the Incas, who
became the heirs of all the cultures which had preceded theirs in Peru.

                               CHAPTER II
                     THE RISE OF THE CUZCO DYNASTY


[Illustration: AN INCAIC DOORWAY.]

Throughout the annals of history there is found no parallel to the
extraordinary character and development of the great empire of the
Incas, whose glory and splendor attained such supremacy and shone with
such lustre, under a benign though despotic sovereignty, as to eclipse
all earlier culture in pre-Columbian America. Whatever may have been the
heritage which the Children of the Sun received from their predecessors,
they carefully avoided giving it any importance in their records. The
Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, who wrote the history of his people more than
half a century after the Conquest, says that this rich and mighty
monarchy was founded in the midst of barbarism and degradation and
developed in all its magnificence through the divine direction of noble
princes, who derived their power from heaven alone, and who were both
the spiritual and the temporal rulers of the people, by right of their
celestial origin.

A romantic charm envelopes the fame of the Incas and their brilliant
court, their spectacular religion with its temples prodigally ornamented
with gold and silver, and, above all, their own royal personality, so
impressive in the dignity and sanctity of heaven-born greatness. One
must even confess to resentment when meddlesome scholars seek to take
away any of the prestige of these picturesque Conquerors of the Andes in
favor of an earlier race, or of successive races, whose identity is lost
in a mist of fable and legend, and who can present no such fascinating
pageant to our imagination as do the heroes of Cuzco, with their
mythical genealogy, the fame of their refined theocracy, and the prowess
of their splendid legions. After all, it has not yet been proved that
the lords of Cuzco were not of the same race and origin as the authors
of the most ancient civilization of Peru, and, even, of all America.
Scholars who have studied the language, customs, and monuments of the
ancient Peruvians, find what is evidently a parent influence making
itself felt through all the changing conditions of successive periods,
and in spite of seemingly foreign and unrelated cultures that have
appeared in various localities during the course of the ages. The two
languages which are most generally spoken by the Indians throughout the
territory formerly included in the Incas’ dominion—the Aymará and the
Quichua—are apparently derived from a common stock. May it not be true
that the people who spoke these languages, and to whom are credited the
monuments of Tiahuanaco and Cuzco, were the heirs of a common ancestry,
and that their progenitors were the authors of the earliest culture in
Peru?

Out of the confusion of many legends that are related by the Indians to
account for the origin of the Incas’ empire, the one which is best
known, and most generally approved, because of the poetic beauty of the
conception, tells us that the Sun, the creator of mankind, through
compassion for the deplorable degradation of the world, sent two of his
children, Manco-Ccapac and Mama Ocllo, to regenerate humanity and to
teach the arts of civilized life. The celestial pair, who were not only
brother and sister, but husband and wife, appeared first on an island in
the midst of Lake Titicaca, and from this point they set forth on their
benevolent mission. Lake Titicaca is supposed to have been chosen as the
place of departure because, since it was the first to receive the rays
of the sun when Viracocha dispersed the darkness, it was fitting that
the first messengers of the light of civilization should also appear on
its sacred island. They carried a rod of gold about two feet long and of
the thickness of a man’s finger, having received from their father, the
Sun, instructions to establish themselves in the place where the rod
should sink into the earth at the first stroke. In the _cerro_ of
Huanacaure the golden rod was buried out of sight as soon as it struck
the soil, and here was founded the great empire of the Incas,—“Inca”
meaning “lord,”—which was to flourish and extend its dominion from the
northern border of the present republic of Ecuador to the south of Chile
and from the Pacific Ocean to the eastern valleys of the Andean chain,
covering a territory of more than a million square miles, and giving
protection to at least ten million faithful and industrious subjects,
obedient to the Inca’s laws.

[Illustration: TERRACE OF THE INCA’S PALACE, OLLANTAYTAMBO.]

According to a tradition, which Sebastian Lorente gives us, Manco-Ccapac
was the son of a _curaca_, or chief, of Pacaritambo, in the Apurimac
valley, a youth so beautiful that he was called “the son of the Sun.” He
was left an orphan at an early age, and the fortune-tellers easily
persuaded him that he was of celestial origin. At eighteen or twenty
years of age the boy entered on his great mission. A humble orator, he
erected an altar to Huanacaure, the principal idol of his forefathers,
which the Incas never after failed to invoke in time of danger. With a
few followers he established his dominion, attracting some by promises
and forcing others by threats, while he fascinated the masses by his
magnificent personality. He wore a tunic embroidered in silver, on his
breast glistened a disk of gold, jewels adorned his arms, and gorgeous
plumes formed his headdress. By various means he succeeded in gaining
command over his compatriots, who served his ambition and obeyed his
laws. There is something reasonable and matter-of-fact about this
tradition which inclines one to think that it may have foundation in
truth. It is seen that Manco-Ccapac worshipped the principal idol of his
forefathers, which shows that his plan was to incorporate in the new
religion the most venerated beliefs of the people, and not to antagonize
them by an iconoclastic policy; he set up his government in Cuzco, where
the inhabitants were by nature docile and easily disciplined; he
appeared at the psychological moment when Peru was ready for a new cult
and a new system of laws; and, also, he was dowered with extraordinary
gifts, looked like a king, and was thoroughly acquainted with the
character of his people. There can be no doubt that Manco-Ccapac was a
native of the country, whether he came originally from the Titicaca
plateau and was of Aymará descent, as some authorities claim, or had his
birthplace in the valley of the Apurimac and spoke the language of the
Quichuas, the people “of the green valleys” as the word _Quichua_
signifies. It is said that the Incas themselves spoke neither Aymará nor
Quichua, but a language unknown to the people and not allowed to be
spoken by anyone but royalty.

[Illustration: WALL OF THE PALACE OF ONE OF THE INCAS, CUZCO.]

The dynasty founded by Manco-Ccapac at Cuzco is generally believed to
have dated from the twelfth century. All the genealogies furnished by
historians are more or less incomplete, limiting to thirteen or
fourteen, at most, the number of monarchs who reigned during that long
period of four hundred years. The list of Incas given by Garcilaso de la
Vega, and regarded as the most reliable, contains the names of thirteen
Princes of the Sun. Most of the authorities of importance name
Manco-Ccapac as the founder of the Empire of the Incas, with Mama Ocllo
as Coya, or Empress; though opinion is greatly divided as to their
origin and the date of their imperial accession. One well-known
historian of the Conquest, Montesinos, places the period of the first
appearance of this royal line in the sixth century after the Deluge. It
is related that, during that remote age, there arrived in Cuzco a family
of four couples who civilized this region. The eldest of the four
brothers, having gained possession of the territory, divided it into
four portions, or _suyos_, from which it took the name of Tahuantinsuyo,
“the kingdom of the four regions.” The territory to the south was called
Collasuyo, to the west Cuntisuyo, to the north Chinchasuyo, and to the
east Antisuyo. The youngest brother afterward secured command of the
kingdom and became the first of a line of princes who governed Peru up
to the time of the Spanish Conquest. The most interesting feature of
this tradition is the division of the rule of these monarchs into three
great dynasties, of which the first was that of the Pirhuas (from
_pyru_, meaning “fire,” apparently indicating that they were
fire-worshippers), the second, that of the Amauttas, or wise men, and
the third the Inca dynasty. The first of the Pirhuas founded the city of
Cuzco in the name of Viracocha, “the Supreme Being,” and one of his
successors built a great temple in Cuzco (perhaps Sacsahuaman, which is
believed to antedate the Inca period), while another ruler of the same
royal line is credited with having reformed the calendar, built public
roads and established severe rules in religion. One of these kings, the
record says, “died while repressing an invasion of depraved people from
the plains.” The Amauttas made many wise laws, reformed the calendar and
the religion of Viracocha, organized the military forces of the kingdom
and repelled the Chimus of the plains. During the reign of the last of
the Amauttas, we are told, “was fulfilled the fourth sun of the
Amauttas, and there took place a great invasion of ferocious tribes who
attacked the kingdom in different parts, obliging the sovereigns of
Cuzco to flee to the grottos of Tamputoko for four hundred years, during
which they lost their literature and a great part of the Amautta
culture; the advent of the Incaic dynasty restored the power of the
royal line, and made Cuzco again the centre of a great and beneficent
civilization.” In the light of modern research, which is continually
causing a revision of former ideas regarding the origin and antiquity of
the Peruvian empire, the story of the three dynasties appears to be more
than “the mere fable” which it has been designated by some modern
writers on the subject. It particularly appeals to one as a solution of
the problem of the Incas’ origin, since every feature of Incaic
civilization proves it to be of native character, even though the
predecessors of the “third dynasty” may have arrived from foreign
shores.

[Illustration: RUINS OF THE PALACE OF MANCO-CCAPAC, CUZCO.]

Manco-Ccapac, or, as his name would be written in English, Manco the
Great, occupies a position in among the heroes of the world’s history
not inferior to the exalted pedestal on which we have placed the
founders of empires in the Old World. He possessed the same rare gifts
of bold judgment and fearless initiative which belonged to Alexander the
Great, to Charlemagne, and to other sovereigns who have been “Great”
because they have known both the strength and the weakness of their
people, and by conciliating the one and dominating the other, have made
themselves masters and leaders of mankind. Had Manco-Ccapac not
thoroughly understood the conditions existing at the time when he
entered on his mission, and had he not possessed judgment, tact, and the
dominant qualities of leadership to enable him to win a host of
followers, even his upright character and his humanitarian purpose would
not have proved sufficient to ensure the wonderful success which he
achieved in founding an empire more extensive than ancient Rome, and as
rich as the fabled monarchies of the Orient. Throughout the Inca’s realm
the principles of honesty, industry, and justice were inculcated in
every subject from his cradle, the moral duties of a good Peruvian being
embodied in the Quichua motto of the nation: _Ama sua, Ama aqquella, Ama
llula_, which translated literally means, “Not a thief, Not idle, Not a
cheat.” It is a form of salutation among the Indians of Cuzco to this
day, the response being _Ccampas Ginallattac!_ “The same to you!”

The record of historical events, as they occurred throughout the long
reign of the Inca dynasty, was preserved only by a system of _quipus_,
or knotted cords, the art of writing being unknown to the Incas, or,
according to some authorities, prohibited by law. Only the
_Quipucamayos_, the authorized guardians of the _quipus_, were able to
decipher them. This career was considered one of great honor, and
instruction therein was given in all the provinces, under the direction
of the _Amauttas_, the Savants of the empire. The chief archives of the
state were preserved in Cuzco, where an immense collection of _quipus_
was found by the invading Spaniards, who destroyed the greater part of
them, without having them interpreted. As a consequence, the information
secured by the historians of the Conquest and by writers of later date,
relative to the genealogy and history of the Incas is necessarily
incomplete and, no doubt, inaccurate; though the descriptions of the
appearance, laws, customs, and national development of the people of
Tahuantinsuyo may be considered as generally faithful and reliable.

According to the genealogy given by Garcilaso de la Vega, the first
Inca, Manco-Ccapac, was succeeded by Sinchi Rocca, a peaceful and
prudent ruler, who is said to have taken the first census of his
kingdom, and is credited by some authorities with having made the
division of the empire into the four regions previously named; though,
according to Cieza de Leon, one of the most reliable authors, these
names were applied to four great highways which extended from Cuzco to
the extreme limits of the empire, northward, eastward, southward, and
westward. In any case, the Incas built broad and level roads, from six
to eight feet wide, and in the mountain regions, where they skirted the
steep slopes of the Andean range, they were prevented from wearing away
by the construction of stone embankments; on the plains, the highway was
indicated, as in many countries at the present day, by guide posts at
intervals along its course. Also, _tambos_, or inns, were built at the
distance of a day’s journey apart, and here the traveller could always
find shelter for the night. The third Inca, Lloque Yupanqui, conquered
the Canas, a powerful people of Ayaviri and Pucará, after a struggle
which depopulated their settlements, and forced the emperor to introduce
_mitimaes_, or colonists, to replace them. He also subjugated the Collas
of the present department of Puno.

[Illustration: NICHE IN THE FAÇADE OF THE PALACE OF MANCO-CCAPAC.]

It was during the reign of the fourth Inca, Maita-Ccapac, that the power
and genius of the imperial monarchs began to extend its influence as
never before, and greater pomp and magnificence than had previously been
known attended the coronation and other ceremonials honored by the
sacred and royal presence of the Inca.

Following the course of training required of every heir to the Inca
throne, Maita-Ccapac had, when a youth, passed through the _Huaracu_, a
ceremonial of the greatest importance, and one in which all the young
Inca nobles of his own age—the title of Inca being borne by every
descendant of Manco-Ccapac through the male line—participated, after
having been trained in the same military exercises as the royal prince.
A description of the Huaracu is interesting as showing that these people
had an institution not unlike that of mediæval chivalry in Europe: From
his earliest years, the hereditary prince was given into the care of the
_Amauttas_, to be taught science and religion, especially the latter, as
the Inca was the highest spiritual authority on earth; great attention
was also paid to the military training, as it was desirable that, not
only in wisdom but in military skill, the prince should excel all
contemporaries. At sixteen years of age, the young heir, Maita-Ccapac,
and his companions, following the sacred custom of their race, were
submitted to a public test, supervised and directed by elderly and
distinguished Inca nobles, which included trials of ability in athletics
such as wrestling, jumping, running, besides sham battles, which were
held as a trial of valor, and were so severe that many of the youths
were wounded and a few killed. The royal prince had not shown the least
fear nor evidence of fatigue, though put to the very limit of endurance;
“for,” he said, “if I am afraid of the shadow of a combat, how shall I
be able to meet the enemy in real warfare?” These exercises lasted for
thirty days, during which the prince slept on the ground, went
barefooted and dressed simply, thus showing his sympathy with the
poorest of his future subjects. The tests concluded, the order of
knighthood was conferred by the Inca emperor, father of Maita-Ccapac,
all the young nobles who had taken part in the exercises kneeling with
the royal heir, one after another, while the emperor pierced their ears
with the _yauri_, a kind of gold needle made for the purpose, which
remained in the ears until the hole was large enough to permit the
insertion of the earrings peculiar to the Incas; these were not hung
from the ears but were placed in the pierced opening, and replaced from
time to time by rings of larger circumference, until, as in the case of
Maita-Ccapac, the cartilage of the lobe was so stretched that it touched
the shoulder. After this ceremony the greatest of the Inca nobles placed
on the feet of the royal heir the sandals of his particular order; a
scarf of similar significance to the _toga virilis_ of the Romans was
wound around his waist, and his head was adorned with a wreath of
flowers,—to indicate that clemency and goodness should adorn the
character of the valiant warrior,—while evergreen, intertwined with the
flowers, symbolized the eternal endurance of such virtues. A fillet of
finest vicuña wool was bound around his head, and a yellow _masca
paicha_, a kind of fringe, also woven of vicuña wool, was added to this
headdress, falling over the brows. The yellow _masca paicha_ was the
peculiar insignia of the heir-apparent. As soon as this ceremony was
concluded, all the Inca nobles knelt before the prince and rendered him
homage as their sovereign. From this time, he was entitled to take his
seat among the advisers of his father, so that he might be initiated
into the art of governing and become familiar with politics and
administration. Being recognized as of age, and the heir to the throne,
he was given command of his father’s armies and was entitled to display
the royal standard of the rainbow in his military campaigns.

The coronation of Maita-Ccapac was the occasion of grand pageants,
continued fiestas, and a brilliant display of royal magnificence. We are
told that he “was crowned with a blue _masca paicha_ and wore a tunic of
white and green, dotted with crimson butterflies.” His royal robe was
made of finest vicuña wool and was ornamented with gold and precious
stones. The headdress of all Inca emperors was particularly
distinguished by two feathers which were placed upright in the front of
the encircling _llautu_, or fillet; these feathers were plucked from the
wing of the sacred bird _Cori-quenca_, a species of gull, black and
white in color, one feather being taken from the right wing of the male
and the other from the left wing of the female, to adorn the royal
crown. These birds may still be seen in the vicinity of Lake Vilcanota,
near Cuzco.

[Illustration: INCA FOUNTAIN AT CUZCO.]

An invincible warrior, Maita-Ccapac extended the power of the empire to
the remote borders of Collasuyo (now Bolivia) and beyond the Apurimac to
Arequipa and Moquegua. His name is connected with one of the most
notable works achieved in the history of the mediæval world, as he is
said to have been the author of the method and plans used, by his
command, in the construction of the first suspension bridge ever built.
Over this bridge, which was swung across the Apurimac River, he passed
with an army of twelve thousand men, making an easy conquest of the
enemy, who were struck with awe in the presence of such a wonderful
feat. A second bridge, built by one of the successors of Maita-Ccapac,
is still to be seen near the site of the original construction. Many of
the _andenes_, of which traces are to be observed to-day in various
parts of the country, were also constructed during the reign of
Maita-Ccapac, though the origin of these terraced farms on the mountain
side is placed by some authorities back in pre-Incaic times. The andenes
were so named from Anti, a province east of Cuzco, and were formed by
building stone walls on the mountain sides, at short distances one above
the other from the base to the summit, and filling the enclosed space
with fertile soil, some of it being mixed with guano from the Chincha
Islands, as the Incas knew the fertilizing value of this deposit and
made general use of it in their agriculture. A tradition of the time of
the fourth Inca relates that the loyal subjects in one of the provinces
built a grand palace of copper in which to entertain Maita-Ccapac and
his Coya when they visited that part of the kingdom; and, though this
story is no doubt a fable, yet it is certain that mining made great
progress during this reign. It is marvellous that, with only the
primitive means at their command, without iron, powder, or machinery,
these people extracted gold both from quartz and placer mines, and
obtained silver, tin, and copper as well. The metal was smelted in small
furnaces and then emptied into moulds; the beautiful ornaments which
were made for the adornment of the temples and palaces and for the
Inca’s wear, afford a proof of the remarkable ingenuity of these
primitive artifices. The successor of Maita-Ccapac, Inca-Ccapac
Yupanqui, “the Avaricious,” did not achieve great fame, though he spent
the greater part of his reign in subduing turbulent subjects in various
parts of the kingdom. He was a miser, and ordered that all who died
should be interred with their gold and jewels, his object being to
secure this treasure later for the royal coffers.

[Illustration: RUINS AT OLLANTAYTAMBO.]

Inca Rocca, the sixth monarch of the royal house of Cuzco, was one of
its greatest warriors and most renowned statesmen. The fame of his
conquests spread to the most remote regions, and the wisdom of his
administration was no less widely known and admired. Everywhere great
palaces were reared to display the grandeur of his imperial house, and
it was decreed that, at his death, all the vast treasures collected for
their adornment should be used to ornament his tomb and for the service
of his family; his successors followed his example, and the brilliancy
of the Inca’s court increased with each subsequent reign. He founded
schools for the education of the nobility under the direction of the
Amauttas, though the children of the common people were not admitted,
because, according to his view, it was enough for them to learn the
trade of their fathers. He was, however, very solicitous for the welfare
and protection of all his subjects, and made strict laws that punished
with death homicides, incendiaries, and thieves.

[Illustration: STONE WALLS OF THE PALACE OF OLLANTA, OLLANTAYTAMBO.]

When the sceptre passed from Inca Rocca to Yahuar Huaccac, whose name
signifies “he who weeps blood,” the great fiestas that were held to
celebrate his coronation gave little premonition of the sad ending that
was to befall this unhappy monarch, who was deposed and died alone in
the desert, some say, at the hand of an assassin. The coronation
ceremony was as brilliant and imposing as that of his illustrious father
had been, the young king wearing “a black tunic and a blue manta dotted
with lizards, with a white _masca paicha_ and plumage of gold.” It is
said that the cause of his “weeping blood” was the arrogant,
self-willed, and quarrelsome disposition of the heir-apparent, and the
impossibility of holding him under restraint. At last, his patience
exhausted, the emperor banished his unmanageable son from court and
condemned him, under penalty of death if he disobeyed, to spend the
remainder of his life among the shepherds on the hills of Chitapampa, a
league away from Cuzco. Three years the young prince passed in herding
sheep, and, as subsequent events proved, in learning other things
besides. At the end of that time he braved his father’s sentence of
death and returned to the royal palace, where, upon being received by
the Inca, he related a remarkable story of a vision that had appeared to
him while he was tending his flocks—a vision of a majestic personage,
clad in a tunic that reached the ground, and wearing a long beard—and
thus spoke to him: “I am the god Viracocha, who created man and all that
is on the earth; yet you hold me in no more veneration than the sun, the
lightning, and other works of my hands. I come to notify you that the
tribes of Chinchasuyo are gathering a great army to advance against the
holy city. Announce it to your father, by my order, so that he may be
warned in time to repel the invaders. For yourself, never fear; in
whatever adversity I will be with you and will give you the help you
need.” The emperor discredited the prince’s story and made no
preparations for war; but the son was soon informed through various
channels that an army of thirty thousand men was marching toward Cuzco;
and, as the royal legions were scattered—it being the custom among the
Incas, as among the Romans, to dismiss their soldiers after a campaign
and to keep no large standing army—the banished prince took matters into
his own hands, and, as his father fled from the capital, he entered it,
gathered a large military force by the power of his eloquence and the
indomitable spirit of a born warrior, and went forth to meet the enemy.
After a prolonged and sanguinary struggle the invaders were driven back,
and the victor entered Cuzco in triumph, amidst the acclaims of a
grateful people. He was immediately crowned Inca Emperor, with the name
of Viracocha.

[Illustration: RUINS OF THE TEMPLE OF THE INCA VIRACOCHA, NEAR CUZCO.]

[Illustration: SEATS FROM WHICH THE INCA AND HIS SUITE VIEWED THE
SACRIFICES.]

It is related of Viracocha that, upon his return from the battlefield,
he sent three messages; the first to the Temple of the Sun and its
priests, commanding that sacrifices be offered in thanks; the second to
the Mamaconas, or abbesses, in the convent of the vestal virgins; and
the third to his father. The Incas never forgot the obligations of their
dual sovereignty, and in proportion as their earthly power was extended
and increased, the evidences of their spiritual glory became more
impressive, and might be seen in the greater riches of the temple, the
increased splendor of the annual feasts, and the higher interpretation
given to their religion. The priests in the various provinces numbered
more than the imperial army, four thousand being engaged in the service
of the temple in Cuzco alone. The high priest who stood at the head of
the order held his divine office for life and was a near relative of the
Inca, as were his colleagues in charge of the various temples throughout
the provinces, the rest of the priesthood being chosen from among the
_curacas_, who were chiefs of conquered territories, and formed one of
the three orders of nobility. The highest nobility of the realm was
represented in the princes and princesses of the blood royal, either
children of the Coya, the queen-mother, or of the numerous wives in the
royal seraglio; next in rank were the Incas “by privilege,” who were
descended from the companions and followers of Manco-Ccapac, and who, in
dignities and dress, were hardly to be distinguished from the royal
family; and finally, the rank of the Curacas, which depended greatly
upon the importance of the territory over which they had ruled before
its conquest by the Inca; though in every case the Curacas held a
position of authority, their number increasing in proportion to the
extension of the Inca’s empire. The Incas were obliged to grant especial
privileges to the Curacas, as otherwise they could not have held in
obedience the conquered people, who regarded these chiefs with great
reverence.

[Illustration: THE RODADERO, CUZCO, SITE CHOSEN FOR RUNNING CONTESTS OF
THE HUARACU.]

It was also in accordance with religious sentiment that the second
message of Viracocha should have been directed to the Mamaconas, who
were the guardians of the vestal virgins, and were appointed to this
office after they had themselves grown old in watching over the sacred
fire that burned forever on the altar. Not only did the Virgins of the
Sun watch over the sacred fire, but they wove all the beautiful garments
of vicuña wool used in the apparel of the Inca and his family, they
worked the exquisite embroideries that adorned the hangings of the
temple, and they were indispensable in the preparation of the
magnificent feasts that celebrated the Inca’s triumphs; probably it was
this last fact which led Viracocha to send his second message to the
Mamaconas; for the splendors of the festivities held in honor of his
triumph over the enemy and his coronation as Inca Emperor eclipsed all
previous celebrations, not only in the capital but throughout the
empire. The message from Viracocha to his royal father could hardly have
afforded unalloyed satisfaction, since it evidently conveyed the
intention of the victor to possess the spoils, in the form of the
imperial _llautu_, and to occupy the throne which his energy and courage
had successfully guarded, when the cowardly flight of Yahuar Huaccac
exposed it to destruction.

In the first year of his eventful reign, Viracocha ordered the
construction of the sumptuous temple of which the majestic ruins are
still to be seen twenty miles south of Cuzco. The walls of the temple
were erected on an elevated base, which was built with five _andenes_,
or steps, leading up to it from the level of the plain, and the temple
covered an area one hundred and twenty feet long by twenty-five feet
wide, the wall being built of hewn stone from the ground up to half its
height, and of adobe for the remainder. The edifice had eight lofty
doors and as many windows, and on one side stood an altar with a statue
of the deity Viracocha, representing him, as he appeared to the prince
during his banishment, “with a flowing beard.” It is believed by many
writers that this temple, which shows a different architecture from that
of all other Incaic edifices, was constructed before the advent of
Manco-Ccapac by the Canas (whom the third Inca subjugated at great
cost), and that Viracocha did no more than to restore and embellish it.

Viracocha took advantage of all means to extend and increase the power
of his monarchy, and, in addition to the famous temple “Viracocha,” he
ordered the construction of many others, as well as of new palaces and
gardens in various parts of the empire. He made journeys to all the
conquered provinces, and while in Collasuyo, at the head of an army of
thirty thousand men, he received ambassadors from Charcas, who came to
render homage to so great a prince; it is said that from these
emissaries the Incas first received information about a country to the
south, called “Chile,” which was destined later to be added to the
territories in vassalage to the emperors of Cuzco. During Viracocha’s
reign, eleven provinces were added to the empire.

One of the greatest engineering feats accomplished under the
civilization of the Incas, was the construction, by Viracocha’s order,
of an extensive irrigating canal, twelve feet in depth and nearly four
hundred miles long, which, crossing the present departments of
Huancavelica and Ayacucho, watered the plains of Castrovireina and
Cangallo, making them green and flourishing pasture lands. This
enterprise is the more remarkable when the nature of the country is
considered, as the work was carried on at an altitude of from twelve to
sixteen thousand feet above sea level, and in the face of such obstacles
as gigantic rocks that had to be removed without blasting machinery or
iron implements, great ravines to be bridged and mountain torrents to be
harnessed and utilized. The hydraulic works constructed by the Incas are
the wonder and admiration of all who have seen the evidences of their
extent and perfection that remain to this day in the sierra and the
coast region. Natural lakes at the head of the coast valleys were in
many instances enlarged, and immense dams and aqueducts were built to
conduct to the irrigating canals the water which descended from the
mountain summits to the barren coast land.

At the death of Viracocha the sceptre passed to his eldest son, who,
however, was too dull and weak, the records say, to rule over an empire
composed of so many elements that had not as yet become settled and
consolidated into a united people. It required a strong hand and clear
judgment to direct the affairs of state so that rebellion should not
overturn the rapidly growing power of the Incas, and that successful
insurrection might not lessen the prestige of a monarchy that claimed
celestial origin. The second son of Viracocha, Pachacutec, was the
opposite of his brother in character, and possessed all the requirements
of a monarch which the other lacked. He was elevated to the throne on
his brother’s death, about the middle of the fourteenth century, and
began his reign by cementing the bonds that held the various tributary
provinces loyal to the sovereignty of Cuzco, and by making new
conquests, in which the military genius of his son, the heir-apparent,
was displayed in deeds as valorous and noble as those performed by his
illustrious father.

                              CHAPTER III
                      THE VAST EMPIRE OF THE INCAS


[Illustration: CORNER-STONE OF AN ANCIENT FORTRESS, CUZCO.]

Although Viracocha was one of the greatest monarchs of Cuzco, it was his
son who brought the Inca dynasty to such a high degree of prestige and
power that the great empire gained unprecedented wealth and territory.
Pachacutec has been called the second Manco-Ccapac, and his name
signifies “he who creates the world anew,” showing what an exalted place
he occupied among the Inca emperors in the annals of his country. He was
an accomplished diplomatist as well as a skilful warrior, a statesman of
far-seeing judgment, and a philosopher. It was as a diplomatist that he
gained the coöperation and loyal service of the curacas of newly
conquered provinces, and by his skill as a warrior that his armies were
so well organized and disciplined as to win victories in all the
campaigns which the heir-apparent led against the tribes of the coast,
carrying his conquests from Pisco, Nasca, Ica, and Pachacámac to the
realm of the hitherto much dreaded and altogether invincible Grand
Chimu. The name of the young prince, Tupac-Yupanqui, is particularly
associated with the conquest of Cajamarca; and the return of the hero to
Cuzco at the close of that campaign was made the occasion of a national
celebration throughout the empire.

It must have been an imposing and magnificent spectacle when the Emperor
Pachacutec met the victorious prince outside of the capital on his
return from Cajamarca, and entered the city with the royal heir, the
latter “borne in a gold litter on the shoulders of conquered chiefs and
preceded by troops of newly gained vassals, who sang the glories of the
prince, with the triumphant ‘Haylli!’ to thrill the heart of the
multitude and carry them beyond bounds as they caught its victorious
note.” The pathway of the prince was covered with flowers, and crossed
at short intervals by triumphal arches. The curacas marched at the head
of processions from the different provinces, each in their local
costumes, dancing and singing songs of victory; these were followed by
the legions of the army, who filled the air with cheers for their
general. The nobility came next in line, splendid in court dress and
brilliant ornaments; and, lastly, the royal litter of the emperor side
by side with that of the prince, gave to the pageant its culminating
glory. The procession wound its way through the streets to the Temple of
the Sun, where, with impressive ceremonies, thanks were rendered to the
deity whose protection they believed had won the great victory.

The Inca’s armies entered the valleys of Pachacámac, Rimac, and Chancay
late in the fourteenth century, and effected the allegiance of all that
territory with little resistance; though it was an alliance rather than
a conquest which the monarch of Cuzco proposed to the powerful ruler of
the Yungas, as the people of that region were called. According to their
treaty, the lord of Pachacámac was to keep his dominions, though under
the authority of the imperial government; and the religion of Pachacámac
was to be protected, on condition that the people also worshipped the
Sun. It was after this alliance that the Temple of the Sun and the
Convent of the Vestal Virgins were erected near the ancient edifice
dedicated to the Creator. Later, the chiefs of this part of the coast
region united their forces with the armies of Cuzco and marched against
the Grand Chimu, glad to render assistance in an effort to crush their
common enemy. The trained legions of Cuzco suffered greatly at first, on
account of the intense heat, and their general was forced to send to his
father for reinforcements; the resistance was stronger and more resolute
than that of any enemy the Incas had hitherto encountered; but repeated
reinforcements arrived, and the archers, lancers, and catapult regiments
made havoc in the Chimu’s dominions, which was intensified when the
enemy turned the course of the rivers that flowed from the sierra, to
drain their plantations, and famine added to the horrors of combat.
Capitulations were made, the Inca permitting the Grand Chimu to govern
his dominions, as had been done in the treaty of Pachacámac, and
exacting only that the people should render homage to the Inca and
worship the Sun. A general edict was issued by Pachacutec at this time
which proved one of the most powerful agencies in the consolidation of
his great empire; it was decreed that all vassals of the realm should
learn Quichua, and teachers were appointed in every province to see that
the language was taught and used throughout the country. All government
officials were obliged to know the national idiom and no one was
permitted to occupy a place of authority or to have dignities or
seignory conferred upon him if he could not speak it. Every soldier of
the army, which grew to number two hundred thousand men, spoke this
language.

[Illustration: ANCIENT STREET OF CUZCO, SHOWING INCAIC WALLS.]

During the reign of Pachacutec, the government of the empire was
established on a firmer basis than ever, and legislation, though in
reality only an expression of the supreme will of the Inca (there was no
word for “law,” which was rendered _apupsimi_, “the word of the chief”),
made clear to every subject what his duties were to his sovereign and to
the state. The Inca Pachacutec ordered that all children over five years
of age should have some employment appropriate to their age and their
father’s profession. The blind, mute, and lame were given light work,
and even the most ignorant and weak-minded were employed, as a safeguard
against laziness. On the other hand, he set aside three days in each
month for fiestas, and harvest time was a season of general rejoicing.
The lands of the empire were all owned by the Inca and agriculture was
the chief occupation of his subjects; the Inca himself turned the first
furrow every year, with a golden plough. The products of the harvest
were divided into three parts; first, the Inca’s share was set aside to
sustain the splendor of the throne and tomeet public necessities; then
the share for the Sun was devoted to the needs of the church, the
priests and all who served in the temples; and finally the communities
received their share, out of which each tiller of the soil was provided
with what he needed. Private property did not exist, and no one had any
individual rights whatever; on the other hand, every subject was given
food and clothing and a house in which to live, though only as the
Inca’s dependent ward, who could never hope to outgrow his “minority.”
It is not surprising that patience and obedience became the
predominating virtues of the race! The system of administration, which
made it possible for the Inca to maintain his absolute authority over
such a vast territory and population is explained partly in the frequent
transporting of _mitimaes_, or colonists, from their native province to
another, which prevented concerted plans for revolt, and partly in the
division of the population into decades, or groups of ten, five of these
groups constituting a body of fifty, two of these bodies making a
centenary, and so on, the whole empire being governed in provinces of
ten thousand inhabitants; each of the subdivisions had an officer in
authority who was answerable to the chief officer of the larger group of
which his division formed a part, until the supreme authority was
reached. As may be supposed, the larger divisions were under the
direction and control of the nobles, the provinces of ten thousand being
governed by the Inca nobility, who had command over the curacas and
other territorial officers of his district.

The subjects of the Inca could not even choose their life partners;
matrimony was obligatory and, as its results affected the well-being of
the state, the Inca maintained the right to govern in this as in all
other matters. In the royal family, the ceremony was performed by the
emperor himself, though in marriages of lesser importance his officers
discharged this formality, appointing a day for a general ceremony, when
all the young men of from twenty to twenty-five and girls of from
eighteen to twenty presented themselves in a row, the men in front;
after the wedding, the young people took possession of the houses which
their community was obliged to build for them, the furniture being
supplied by their family. No one could marry outside of his or her
_parcialidad_, or township, and, as it was obligatory to wear the dress
of one’s forefathers and not to move from any town to another without
leave from the authorities, it may readily be understood that the
costumes worn in the various sections of Peru were as distinctive of
class and locality as is the Scotch tartan. The custom still remains in
the sierra, and the effect is most picturesque.

Throughout the long reign of sixty years which is given by the
historians to Pachacutec, his sagacity and benevolence were seen in
every branch of his administration. He died at the age of eighty years,
and left the throne to Tupac-Yupanqui, the tenth emperor of Cuzco, who
made the conquest of Chile as far south as the Maule River, and spent
three years visiting his kingdom. The royal progress was of the most
magnificent description; the litter of the great monarch was resplendant
with gold and precious jewels, displaying in its adornment the sacred
symbols of sun worship, as it was borne on the shoulders of the Inca’s
proudest nobles. With a gorgeous retinue the great lord of Cuzco
proceeded along the highway, which was lined throughout the route by
adoring subjects, who strewed the pathway of their deity-king with
flowers and sang songs in his praise; when the transcendent glory of the
Son of the Sun was revealed to them for a brief moment, as the curtains
of the litter were raised and the royal countenance became visible,
their acclamations were joyous and fervent beyond words. According to
Sarmiento, one of the early historians, the royal guard and retinue that
accompanied the Incas always made a splendid spectacle. Close to the
litter of the emperor, and forming a brilliant and impenetrable guard,
were his majesty’s halberdiers and archers on each side, five thousand
soldiers in front, with catapults (weapons used with unfailing effect by
the armies of Cuzco), and as many lancers with their captains behind,
while heralds hurried back and forth, clearing the way and announcing
the approach of the mighty lord. The people were glad to see their
monarch, not only to witness the glory and splendor in which he
appeared, but also because it was the royal custom, observed by
Manco-Ccapac and all his successors, for the Inca to take this
opportunity of hearing his people’s grievances and regulating matters
referred to his decision by the provincial tribunals. Wherever he halted
grand fiestas were celebrated in his honor; and so well stocked with
provisions were the royal _tambos_, that all the Inca’s suite, as well
as his troops, could be served with their accustomed food and all
comforts. The Inca was kept in constant communication with Cuzco—no
matter how far away from the capital his travels might lead him—by his
_chasquis_, or postboys. On all the principal roads leading from Cuzco
post offices were established, not like the modern repositories of
letters, but small huts, in which a number of _chasquis_ were stationed
to receive and carry forward messages of the government. These posts
were only a few miles apart, and the _chasquis_, who were chosen for
their fleetness as runners as well as for their fidelity, were relieved
by a perfect system of relays, so that it was possible for messages to
be carried fifty leagues in a day. The _chasquis_ were of great value in
times of war, as may readily be seen, and they were also pressed into
the domestic service of the royal palace, being employed to bring
fruits, game, and (we are seriously informed by the historian) even
fish, from the tropical coast region, for the imperial table.

[Illustration: SHOWING THE TWELVE-ANGLE STONE, RUINS AT CUZCO.]

Tupac-Yupanqui is named by some authorities as the successor of Inca
Yupanqui, to whom they give all the glory of the long and brilliant
reign which others credit to Tupac-Yupanqui. On the other hand, many
historians say that Inca Yupanqui’s reign was brief and uneventful,
except for his campaigns, undertaken to subdue the Mojos of the region
of the Beni and the Chiriguanas of the Bolivian Chaco. He failed in both
enterprises and then turned his armies toward Quito, though with little
better success. Tupac-Yupanqui had a young son, however, who was
destined to bring the power and prestige of the Children of the Sun to
the very zenith of glory. This prince, whose name was Huayna-Ccapac,
took command of the imperial forces in the later years of his father’s
life and marched against the king of Quito, whom he defeated, gaining
possession of his kingdom. Alas, the conquest of Quito, the most
brilliant victory yet won by the Children of the Sun, proved to be “the
beginning of the end,” the source of the disunion of the great Inca
empire, a calamity which contributed in an important degree to make it
possible for a small group of invaders to accomplish the downfall of one
of the most powerful monarchies that ever developed among a primitive
people!

[Illustration: THE INCA’S BATH, OLLANTAYTAMBO.]

The historical records of the reign of Huayna-Ccapac are generally
regarded as reliable, since he died only a few years before the arrival
of the Spaniards, and the events of his government were still fresh in
the minds of his people. Not only did this monarch add to the number of
magnificent temples and palaces erected throughout the empire, but he
built a new highway from Cuzco to Quito and completed the great road
from the capital to Chile. The famous tradition of Ollantaytambo is said
to have its origin in the rebellion of one of the nobles of the court of
Huayna-Ccapac, named Ollanta, who resisted the power of the Inca in his
stronghold until finally conquered by the superior strength of the
emperor’s forces. The ruins of Ollantaytambo, forty miles north of
Cuzco, are among the most imposing in Peru, though according to some
archæologists the edifice was built in pre-Incaic times, and was only
restored and embellished by the Incas. The same is said of nearly all
the great temples, except Coricancha, the Temple of the Sun, in Cuzco,
and a few others, though it is not certain in whose reign Coricancha was
built; probably the work of construction extended over several reigns.
Huayna-Ccapac is said to have had a strong leaning toward philosophy,
and, like some of his predecessors, he gave numerous proverbs and
mottoes to his people, which the early historians were able to get from
the quipucamayos. He was the first to declare that he believed in the
existence of a higher power than the Sun, and the reason he gave for
this disloyalty to the deity of the Incas is very interesting. It is
related that he first gave expression to his new creed during a visit to
his subjects of Collasuyo. He had gone with his court to spend some time
on the sacred island of the Sun in Lake Titicaca, where he is said to
have devoted much attention to plans of reform, in religion, industries,
and other features of administration. From this point he had visited the
monuments of Tiahuanaco, and was celebrating the great annual feast of
Raymi at Chuquiapu (La Paz, Bolivia). His uncle, the chief priest of the
temple, observed that the Inca spent much time gazing at the sun, and
said to him, “Thou knowest, Inca, that it is not permitted to look so
freely at our father, the Sun, and thou art causing a grand scandal in
the court and among all thy subjects assembled to worship our supreme
lord.” In return, the emperor asked: “Is there anyone in the empire who
could oblige me to make a long journey? Is there anyone who would dare
to disobey me if I ordered him to journey to Chile?” “No,” was the
answer of the priest; “No one would dare to give orders to his
sovereign, nor to disobey him.” “Then I tell you,” replied the Inca,
“that our father, the Sun, has a ruler greater and more powerful than
himself; for the sun never rests on the journey which he makes every
day, and the supreme lord no doubt does things leisurely and halts when
it pleases him, even though he has no need of repose.”

The feast of Raymi was the most brilliant and popular of all the
national celebrations. It usually took place at Cuzco, as the permanent
residence of the Inca was in that city, and was held at the period of
the summer solstice, which, south of the equator, occurs in December.
Three other fiestas of especial importance were held during the year to
celebrate the solstices of June, March, and September, though none of
these equalled in elaborate ceremony and display the “Ccapac-Raymi.” For
three days previous to the 21st of December there was a general fast,
and on the morning of that day the Inca, in company with his family and
the nobles of his court, attired in gala dress and wearing their most
gorgeous adornments, awaited the appearance of the rising sun. A
multitude filled the plaza, presenting in the variety of their dress and
ornaments,—as they represented the different tribes gathered under the
standard of the rainbow in many campaigns,—the aspect of an assembly
gathered from the four corners of the globe. As the sun rose, smiling on
the sacred city in benediction, the crowd broke forth in a shout of
praise and thanksgiving; while joyous songs and the melody of music from
a thousand curious instruments throbbed on the air. Dr. Lorente in
describing this feast says: “The Inca, filling two glasses with
_chicha_, (a fermented liquor of maize, the popular drink of the Indians
in the sierra to-day as it was hundreds of years ago,) offered them to
his divine father, the Sun, and then poured the contents of the glass he
held in his right hand into a golden receptacle, which by a secret
channel flowed into the Temple of the Sun. The contents of the other
glass were first sipped by the Inca, who passed it to his nobles that
they might do the same.” After this libation, all repaired to the
temple, which they entered barefooted, the multitude being required to
remove their sandals two hundred steps from the sacred portal, which
they might not enter. After the Inca’s invocation to the Sun, the
procession made its way to the plaza where the sacrificial offerings of
llamas were made and the feasting began in all its intensity. It lasted
for a week, during which the chicha jars—huge earthenware vessels—were
increased and refilled constantly, and dancing was kept up day and night
without ceasing. The feast of the harvest, held the 21st of March, was
regarded with great reverence, as it was then the fire was drawn from
the Sun’s rays to light the sacred flame for the altar; the rays were
focussed on a metallic mirror which the Inca wore in a bracelet on his
right arm, and by this means a small piece of cotton was ignited, the
fire being then guarded by the Virgins of the Sun until the feast of the
ensuing year.

[Illustration: THE HOUSE OF THE SERPENTS, CUZCO.]

Under the influence of a common religion, a common language, and a
common government the consolidation of the great Inca empire was
effected, and it must be conceded that the benevolent character of the
despotism which its sovereigns exercised was the saving feature of a
system which must seem, to the freedom-loving spirit of the twentieth
century, the worst species of barbarism. Yet for a primitive people, who
shall say that the government of Cuzco did not accomplish more toward
civilizing them than a less autocratic but more oppressive system would
have done? In the course of time, might not Inca philosophers, such as
Pachacutec and Huayna-Ccapac, more advanced in their ideas by social
evolution, gradually extend more privileges to their subjects and lift
them up to a higher level? The empire had apparently reached its
farthest boundaries with the conquests of Chile and Quito, and the
period of insurrection and insubordination had passed, as a result of
wise measures taken to bind all the Inca’s subjects together in a common
interest, through the practice of a common religion and the exclusive
use of a common language. It was the most promising moment in the
development of the race.

The story of Huayna-Ccapac’s fear and foreboding when the news was
carried to him in his palace on the island of Lake Titicaca that “white
and bearded men” had been seen in the region of the coast, and of his
retirement to Quito to pass the remainder of his days in the society of
his favorite Pacha, the mother of Atahuallpa, is well known.
Unfortunately, the poetical romance of Atahuallpa’s birth in the
conquered city of his mother’s people, and of his winning the proud
heart of his father, so that the rightful heir to the throne of Cuzco
was relegated to a second place in the Inca’s affections, has been
pronounced a fable; because Atahuallpa was twelve years old when
Huayna-Ccapac conquered Quito. But, on the other hand, there is no proof
that Huayna-Ccapac did not invade Quito previous to its conquest. At any
rate, the story is _bien trouvée_. The question of disposing of his
empire vexed the great Inca, who wished to provide well for his favorite
son, but was bound to recognize the exalted rights of the Coya’s heir,
Huascar, at whose birth the national rejoicings had been greater than on
the natal day of any other prince of Cuzco. The legend of Huascar’s
golden chain, which was long enough to encircle the plaza of Cuzco three
times, is still repeated, and expeditions still seek it in the various
places where it is said to have been concealed on the approach of the
Spaniards. Finally the throne of Cuzco was given to Huascar, and that of
Quito to Atahuallpa. Neither was satisfied, and their quarrels and
combats resulted in dividing the empire under rival powers at the
supreme moment when unity was its only hope for salvation.

                               CHAPTER IV
            THE SPANISH DISCOVERY AND INVASION UNDER PIZARRO


[Illustration: ANCIENT STREET OF CUZCO.]

While the empire of the Incas was approaching the zenith of its
greatness in America, Spain was extending the power and prestige of the
House of Austria throughout Europe under the sovereignty of the Emperor
Charles V. And the proud dynasty of the Hapsburgs, whose double-headed
eagle was destined to obscure the Sun of Tahuantinsuyo and to efface the
sacred Rainbow in its shadow, did not represent a more exalted royalty
in the Old World than did that of Manco-Ccapac in the New. There are
even some points of resemblance between the two monarchies, so remotely
separated in origin and traditions. In Peru, as in Spain, the army and
the Church were the only occupations worthy of the nobility; in both
countries, wars of conquest were fought in the name of religion, with
the emblem of salvation in one hand and that of destruction in the
other,—the Inca with the golden disk and the catapult, the Spaniard with
the Cross and the sword; and both led their armies against the infidel
with the determination to destroy his idols and to establish the true
worship.

However much we may condemn the method of the Spanish conquerors, their
mission was not altogether mercenary in its purpose. It is not strange
that the yellow metal dimmed their consciences when it blazed before
their eyes on the temples of Mexico and Peru; yet, even then, as
Prescott says: “In the motives of action, meaner influences were
strangely mingled with the loftier, the temporal with the spiritual.”
The hardy and romantic adventurers who followed in the wake of Columbus
were not merely sordid gold hunters; they were the descendants of
soldiers who had for centuries fought in the holy wars of the Cross
against the Crescent, and in their veins flowed the blood of the
knight-errant and the crusader. Gold they sought with eagerness and
without scruple; but they wanted glory almost as much as they wanted
gold, and in the pursuit of both, they carried aloft the banner of the
Church, and sought the blessing of its ministers. As soon as a newly
discovered land was taken possession of in the name of the King of
Spain, the Cross was elevated in token of the triumph of Christianity.
Columbus erected the Cross in Hispaniola, and Cortés followed up his
victory over the Aztecs with their forcible conversion to the true
faith. In Peru, a less pious discoverer than Columbus and a more
ruthless invader than Cortés employed the sacred office of the priest to
aid him in accomplishing an act of treachery so odious that it dims the
glory of his conquest and places him below the standard even of mediæval
adventurers.

Francisco Pizarro, a native of Trujillo in Spain, began life under all
the disadvantages which are the lot of the illegitimate child, but
which, in many instances, school him in a discipline so rigorous that as
he grows to manhood he becomes thoroughly inured to hardship and is able
to dominate the greatest misfortune and to achieve success in the face
of the most discouraging obstacles. Such a discipline is hardly likely
to develop the softer virtues; and, as the young Pizarro received no
care,—either from his father, who was a distinguished colonel under El
Gran Capitan, or from his mother, a humble peasant,—as he was never
taught to read or to write, and spent his boyhood tending swine, it is
not difficult to imagine what extraordinary influences must have moulded
his character, and transformed the swineherd of Trujillo into the
fearless soldier of fortune, known to history as the cruel, rapacious,
and perfidious, though consummately daring, Conqueror of Peru.

The first news of Pizarro as an adventurer in the New World is found in
the record of a disastrous expedition fitted out at Hispaniola for the
purpose of colonization; a few years later he is heard from in
connection with the more successful undertaking led by Balboa, with whom
Pizarro crossed the Isthmus of Panamá, when that celebrated adventurer
discovered the Pacific Ocean. Up to that time, Pizarro, who was then
fifty years of age, had won neither gold nor glory as a reward for his
ambition. In 1522, an expedition, which had been sent southward by the
governor of Panamá, returned with wonderful stories of the wealth and
grandeur of a kingdom that was supposed to lie behind the great range of
the Andes. Pizarro became interested and communicated his enthusiasm to
Diego de Almagro, an adventurer like himself, a native of Castile, and a
foundling. These two enterprising explorers were joined by a third,
named Hernando de Luque, a priest, who furnished most of the funds for
the expedition which it was agreed they would undertake, to search for
the land of treasure. After great reverses and his desertion by many
famished followers on the barren Island of Gallo, Pizarro reached
Tumbes, on the southern shore of the Gulf of Guayaquil, where he found a
populous settlement, rich in temples and palaces ornamented with gold
and silver, and inhabited by a kind and hospitable people. The natives
told the Spaniards that a great and powerful prince ruled over all this
country, whose capital lay behind the mountains and was a city of far
greater wealth and splendor than anything they had yet seen. Could any
news be more welcome to the little band of adventurers in search of this
very treasure? After cruising southward past the present city of
Trujillo, at which they also disembarked for a short stay, and finding
everywhere proofs that they had reached the shores of an opulent
kingdom, the expedition turned northward again toward Panamá; for
Pizarro realized that it would be impossible to attempt the conquest of
such a country with a mere dozen of followers. On their way, they called
again at Tumbes, where a native boy, named Felipillo, was taken on board
to accompany Pizarro to Panamá, so that he might learn the Spanish
language and serve as interpreter when the discoverers should return to
his country to conquer it.

[Illustration: RUINS OF AN INCA’S PALACE.]

[Illustration: THE ANDENES, OR ARTIFICIAL TERRACES, CULTIVATED UNDER THE
INCAS.]

When Pizarro arrived in Panamá, he found the governor not at all
disposed to help him; but, with the aid of his faithful comrades,
Almagro and Father Luque, he was provided with funds to go to Spain and
plead his cause with the king, it being understood that if he succeeded
in getting the royal authorization and protection, he would secure the
office of Adelantado for Almagro and that of Bishop of Tumbes for Father
Luque. Pizarro was well received at the Court of Spain, where Cortés had
recently arrived to present the empire of Mexico to his royal master.
The Council of the Indies, which had charge of all matters relating to
Spain’s possessions in the New World, gave him a grant authorizing him
to make discoveries and conquests in Peru for two hundred leagues
southward from the river Santiago, near the northern border of the
present republic of Ecuador. Pizarro received the rank and titles of
Governor and Captain-general of the province, and the offices of
Adelantado and Chief Magistrate for life with a large salary; he was
also made a Knight of Santiago and was given permission to use his
father’s coat-of-arms with symbols of his own conquest added. Upon his
return to Panamá, he tried to explain to Almagro the reason why he had
accepted all the high offices for himself, but his comrade found it hard
to forgive what he considered an injury done to him by a friend he had
trusted, and an estrangement followed, which was never overcome,
especially as Pizarro’s brothers, Hernando and Gonzalo, who accompanied
him back from Spain, did everything to widen the breach.

[Illustration: SEATS CUT IN SOLID STONE, AT KENKO, NEAR CUZCO.]

In January, 1531, Pizarro and his followers embarked again for Peru.
Before leaving Panamá, the banners of the company and the royal standard
of Spain were consecrated in the Cathedral, mass was performed, and the
sacrament was administered to every soldier. The expedition consisted of
only two hundred men and twenty-seven horses, a small force for so
ambitious an undertaking; but the courageous adventurer had come to
believe so thoroughly in the destiny which held in store for him the
glory of conquering that great kingdom, of whose extent and riches he
had already been permitted the first glimpse, that no power on earth
could have discouraged him in his enterprise; he was full of eager
enthusiasm when his ships sailed out of the harbor, bound for Tumbes,
which he considered the gateway to the Peruvian empire. On his way, he
made brief landings at various points, including the island of Puná in
the Guayaquil River, a few leagues north of the port of Tumbes on the
southern shore of the Gulf of Guayaquil. At Puná the soldiers of Spain
won a hard-fought battle over the fierce natives, during which, the
Spanish chronicler says: “St. Michael was seen to vanquish Satan in
mid-air.” Here the expedition awaited reinforcements, which soon
afterward arrived in two ships commanded by Hernando de Soto, and
consisted of a hundred volunteers as well as a number of cavalry horses;
with this added force, Pizarro proceeded southward to Tumbes, though he
found that recently flourishing city entirely depopulated and
demolished—by their enemies of Puná it was said—and he was obliged to
look for another site for his colony. He sent De Soto with troops to
explore the foothills of the Andes while he himself marched southward
along the plain for about thirty leagues, until he came to a rich valley
watered by several streams, which offered such advantages for settlement
that he sent for his troops to come on from Tumbes; here he founded the
first Spanish colony in Peru, calling it San Miguel in honor of his
victory at Puná; the settlement was removed later to the banks of the
Piura River, where the foundation of the present flourishing city of
Piura took place. During his march, Pizarro had passed thriving Indian
settlements, had been hospitably entertained by the natives and had
learned that the great ruler, in whose dominions he was travelling, was
at that moment only ten days’ journey from Piura. He was told the story
of the quarrel between Atahuallpa and Huascar and was informed that
Atahuallpa’s army had successfully invaded Cuzco and taken Huascar
prisoner; on that very day the victorious Inca was celebrating his
triumph in his camp at Cajamarca, whither he had gone to take the baths.
From the same source, Pizarro learned that the vanquished brother had
been imprisoned at Jauja, where one of the strongest fortresses of the
country was located. All this information was welcome to the Spanish
invader, who saw that the disunion of the empire was a condition greatly
in his favor in the proposed conquest; but he hoped, with all his heart,
that reinforcements would come from Panamá, as his army appeared
ridiculously small to attempt the subjugation of a rich and powerful
monarch, whose bodyguard was composed of the best and bravest of his
warriors, and numbered thousands. It is well said by the author of _The
Conquest of Peru_ that “if Pizarro had stopped to calculate chances, he
must inevitably have failed, as the odds were too great to be combated
reason.” But sober reason is very apt to lack the element of faith,
which is so powerful an agency in the conquest of empires—whether
national, social, or personal. Pizarro believed that he was destined by
heaven to accomplish this seemingly impossible task, and he adopted ways
and means which cautious reason would have condemned, in view of the
almost certain and disastrous consequences. Probably he was inspired by
Cortés’s capture of Montezuma when he planned his attack on Atahuallpa;
but, to one of his spirit and temperament, the means to the end could
hardly have failed, even without the Mexican Conqueror’s example, which,
by the way, he did not worthily imitate, as Cortés would have scorned to
use the unsoldierly tactics that Pizarro employed in the capture and
subsequent murder of the Inca.

[Illustration: ANCIENT BRIDGE OF SANTA TERESA, CUZCO.]

The prospect of getting reinforcements from Panamá appeared less and
less hopeful as the months passed, until finally Pizarro decided to
start on his daring enterprise with only the limited force then at his
command. Leaving fifty soldiers to guard the colony, he set out with one
hundred and eighty men, including sixty-seven cavalry troops, to attempt
a conquest which a more cautious commander would have undertaken only at
the head of a large army.

After journeying for several days without coming within sight of
Cajamarca, Pizarro sent Hernando de Soto to reconnoitre, and, a week
later, was delighted to see his comrade approaching the camp in company
with a personage of evident rank, who was attended by a considerable
retinue, and whom De Soto presented as an ambassador from the Inca
Atahuallpa. This distinguished messenger had come with his royal
master’s greeting to the strangers, and an invitation for them to visit
the Emperor’s camp at Cajamarca. Pizarro, through his interpreter,
Felipillo, made known to the ambassador his appreciation of the Inca’s
fine courtesy; at the same time, he gave strict orders that as long as
the ambassador remained in the Spanish camp he was to be treated with
all the respect due to the representative of a great and powerful
sovereign. When the Peruvian departed, he was charged to convey the
compliments of Pizarro to his royal master and to tell him that the
Spaniards were the subjects of a powerful prince, who ruled beyond the
sea; that they had heard of Atahuallpa’s prowess and had come to pay
their respects to His Majesty and to offer the service of their army
against the Inca’s enemies; and that they would wait upon the great
monarch with the least possible delay.

Having dismissed the Inca’s messenger, Pizarro resumed his march,
choosing the route which he had been advised to take in order to reach
Cajamarca as soon as possible. Embassies from the Inca continued to
arrive with presents of gold, silver and rich vicuña cloths, the
Spaniards sending in return ornaments of glass and other articles
brought from Europe for the purpose. As they ascended the slopes of the
great Andes, they observed that, instead of buildings of sun-dried
bricks, such as were seen in the coast valleys, the temples and palaces
were constructed of huge stones, taken from the solid rock, and so
wonderfully adjusted that not a knife blade could be inserted between
them, though no mortar was used in setting them.

In order to reach Cajamarca, it was necessary for Pizarro and his men to
cross the _cumbre_, or summit of the great Andean range, that rose
before them like an impassable barrier. They had to march through
treacherous defiles, where a mere handful of men in ambush could destroy
a whole army, and the experience was one to be remembered long
afterward; the sudden appearance of a huge fortress high up on the
mountain side, strong enough to defy a regiment and large enough to
shelter an army—the precipices that yawned in front of them at every
turn—the intense cold and rarity of the atmosphere in the high
altitude—were sources of constant fear and discomfort. But the Inca
permitted the invaders to advance without opposition; indeed, he
continued to send embassies to them every time they encamped on the way.
Was it an exaggerated idea of their exalted origin and power, or
absolute confidence in his own strength, or because the very audacity of
Pizarro was incredible, that Atahuallpa permitted the Spaniards to
advance on his encampment, when a small force could have prevented their
crossing the _cumbre_? Perhaps Atahuallpa yielded to curiosity and
permitted the Spaniard to visit his royal stronghold in order that he
and his nobles might study the _rara avis_, intending to capture the
invaders later, by surrounding them with his legions. The conquerors
afterward expressed the opinion that the Inca probably wished to find
out all about them, to have them explain the use of their weapons, etc.,
so that he might profit the more by their capture. One authority says:
“Atahuallpa was very wise and discreet, and, although without
enlightenment, yet a friend of knowledge, and possessing a subtle mind.”

[Illustration: AN INCAIC STREET, CUZCO.]

One of the severest tests of the courage of Pizarro came when he led his
little band out of the last defile of the mountains and saw, from the
eminence on which they stood, the beautiful valley of Cajamarca spread
before his gaze, radiant in the flush of summer time, with broad fields
showing the fruits of industrious husbandry, a prosperous little city
nestling just below, and farther away, at the other side of the valley,
on the sloping hillsides, the encampment of the Inca, apparently
sheltering a mighty host. A member of that bold little company naïvely
relates: “With a courageous countenance, after having thoroughly
surveyed the scene, we descended to the valley, and entered Cajamarca.”
One can easily imagine that behind the “courageous countenance” there
was much sinking of the heart, as the invaders made their way down the
mountain side! While they were descending, the sky became overcast, and
the sunlit valley took on a gloomy aspect. Ominous clouds obscured the
surrounding summits, which a few hours before had glistened like
steel-armored sentinels under the rays of the sun. It was as if the
breath of an unholy ambition had already poisoned the air and the
approaching spectre of crime had thrown its awful shadow across the
place of tragedy.

Pizarro and his band entered Cajamarca on the afternoon of November 15,
1532. They found themselves in a city of considerable size, apparently
the home of about ten thousand people, though, as the Spaniards rode
through its streets, no one came out to welcome them, and they
discovered that it had been entirely deserted by the inhabitants, “in
order to give better accommodation to the distinguished visitors of the
Inca,” as his messengers explained.

Impatient to know the nature of the reception he might expect from
Atahuallpa, Pizarro had no sooner entered Cajamarca than he sent
Hernando de Soto and his brother, Hernando Pizarro, to salute the Inca
and to invite him to dine on the following day, at the same time begging
that his majesty would let them know where they were to make their
headquarters. The Spanish envoys were accompanied by a bodyguard of
cavalry and made their appearance at the Inca’s camp in a sumptuous
manner, dressed in splendid armor and carrying themselves with the
arrogance and grace characteristic of the Castilian. They found the
sovereign in the courtyard of his royal quarters, where he received them
with such absence of demonstration that they were disconcerted and at a
loss to understand his extraordinary attitude. They rode up slowly until
within a few feet of the Inca, when, after making a respectful salute,
Hernando Pizarro repeated his brother’s message. Atahuallpa heard it
without giving the least sign of interest, without even a change of
expression; the only response came from one of his nobles, in the single
word “_Ari_,” which signified “It is well.” It was an embarrassing
moment and left Pizarro’s ambassadors totally ignorant of the Inca’s
intentions; but Hernando Pizarro was not of a disposition to accept such
a situation as final, and he again addressed the Indian sovereign,
requesting him to speak to them himself, explaining that he was
Pizarro’s brother and had come to learn from the Inca’s own lips what
was his royal pleasure. At this, Atahuallpa deigned to answer, with a
smile, that he was keeping a fast, which would end the following
morning, when he would be pleased to visit Pizarro; that, in the
meantime, his guests were to occupy the royal _tambo_, or inn, in the
great square of the city, “except the Hall of the Serpent, in the
midst,” which he reserved for his own use.

During their interview with Atahuallpa, the Spaniards had an excellent
opportunity to observe the Inca, who was seated on a cushion in the
midst of his nobles and the princesses of the royal household. The
monarch, who was thirty years of age, was of grave and kingly bearing,
and had handsome, well-cut features; he wore a simpler costume than his
courtiers, who were gorgeous in gayly ornamented attire; his crown was
the crimson _masca paicha_, which he had assumed with the sovereignty of
Cuzco, after his brother Huascar’s defeat. The appearance of the Inca,
his splendid court, his troops numbering fifty thousand men, the
evidences of great wealth, seen even in the large golden vessels from
which the Spaniards were invited to drink the _chicha_ offered by
Atahuallpa’s order—everything impressed Pizarro’s envoys with the
hopelessness of their scheme of conquest, and they returned to their
chief with gloomy faces.

But Pizarro refused to see, think or hear of anything but success, and
he trampled down every rising fear by the sheer force of his own
confidence and determination; that very night he unfolded his bold plan
of action—to make a sudden attack and seize the Inca in the midst of his
troops. Once in possession of the monarch, Pizarro knew that he could
dictate his own terms, for he had not been slow to recognize the sacred
character of the worship rendered by the Indians to their emperor of
celestial origin. Perhaps he had even calculated on the paralyzing
effect such an audacious and sacrilegious act as the seizure of the Inca
would have on a people completely held under the spell of their
sovereign’s great and transcendent glory. But it is hardly to be
supposed that he could have foreseen their utter prostration in the face
of the calamity he was preparing to visit upon them!

                               CHAPTER V
                          THE CONQUEST OF PERU


[Illustration: COAT-OF-ARMS OF PIZARRO GRANTED BY CHARLES V. IN HONOR OF
THE DISCOVERY OF PERU.]

The Conquest of Peru was not undertaken without a solemn appeal to
heaven, a ceremony which formed the prelude to all enterprises in those
days, of whatever character or purpose. Mass was performed by the
ecclesiastic, Vicente de Valverde, a Dominican friar, who had
accompanied the expedition, and whose share in the events of the
memorable day upon which they were now entering is only to be excused on
the score of over-passionate zeal. During the religious service, the
priest and his assistants invoked the divine aid in behalf of the
soldiers of the Cross who were fighting to establish the Christian
faith; and _Exsurge, Domine_ was chanted with all the enthusiasm that
the most devoted band of Crusaders would have shown on the eve of a
battle with the Moors; the heritage of blood is strong, and in the
exaltation of that moment, it is certain that the baser motives of the
premeditated onslaught were submerged under a tide of religious
emotions. But it is doubtful whether Pizarro allowed the religious side
of the campaign to occupy his mind any further than was required by the
temperament and spirit of his followers; he knew his men, and governed
them through their strongest impulses, which he could control only by
apparent sympathy.

Nothing was left undone in the preparations for capturing the Inca.
Cavalry and infantry were stationed in great halls or barracks that
opened on to the plaza through wide doors, which were to remain closed
until a given signal. The confusing effect of a sudden surprise and
unaccustomed sights and sounds had been carefully studied by Pizarro,
who had two small pieces of ordnance placed in the fortress, and all the
horses adorned with bells on their breastplates. It was understood that
on the firing of the first gun, the whole army should rush into the
plaza with their battle-cry: “Santiago, and at them!” and, after
overpowering and killing the Inca’s guard, they were to capture the
emperor himself and carry him to Pizarro’s quarters.

As if to further the treacherous plan of Pizarro, the Inca sent his
ambassador to say that he would leave the greater part of his army
behind and would enter Cajamarca without arms. A little before sunset
the royal procession began to enter the gates of the city. First came
the army of menials who were employed to clear the pathway of all
obstacles, as was always done in the royal progresses which the Inca was
accustomed to make throughout his kingdom; following these came the
heralds announcing the approach of their sovereign, the nobles and
princes of the blood royal, and lastly the Inca, surrounded by his
bodyguard and a few of his soldiers, all unarmed. The royal palanquin
was lined with the rich plumes of tropical birds and studded with plates
of gold and silver; the monarch, seated on a throne of solid gold, was
magnificently attired, and wore a collar of very large and brilliant
emeralds.

As the great procession entered the plaza of Cajamarca and divided into
two ranks to allow the royal retinue to pass between, the Inca observed
that not a Spaniard was to be seen, and inquired what had become of
them. At this moment Father Valverde stepped into the square, with a
crucifix in one hand and a Bible in the other, and approaching the Inca,
told him that he was there by order of his commander to expound to him
the true faith, for which purpose the Spaniards had come to his country.
He then explained to Atahuallpa the basis of the Christian faith, the
doctrine of the Trinity, and the origin of the Roman Catholic hierarchy,
telling him that the pope had given the Spanish sovereign the right to
conquer and convert the natives of the western hemisphere, and that
Pizarro had arrived to carry out this mission; he concluded by
beseeching the Inca to embrace Christianity and acknowledge himself a
vassal of the Emperor Charles V., who would, in that case, aid and
protect him. Atahuallpa listened to Valverde’s harangue as interpreted
by Felipillo, at first showing only curiosity, then scorn and, finally,
fierce indignation, as the import of its meaning dawned upon him. His
brow darkened with anger when he learned that he was asked to become the
vassal of another, and he exclaimed: “I am the greatest prince on earth,
and will be vassal to none; as for the Pope of whom you speak, he cannot
give away countries which do not belong to him; and as your God was put
to death by the human beings he created, I will not have him in exchange
for mine, who lives there in the heavens and watches over his children!
Where did you learn these things?” Valverde handed him the Bible, which
the monarch looked at as nothing to be admired, either in material or
appearance; he threw it on the ground in disgust, and told the priest to
inform his companions that they would be called to account for all the
evil they had done in his dominions.

The Inca was about to give a royal command to his messengers, when
Valverde, scandalized by the heathen’s contempt for the sacred volume,
and realizing that the effort to convert Atahuallpa had resulted only in
incensing the Inca so that the lives of the Spaniards were in imminent
danger, called out to Pizarro to “waste no more breath on the heathen
reprobate,” exclaiming with all the fervor of the frenzied fanatic:
_Salid á él—que yo os absuelvo!_ “Take him,—I absolve you all!”

[Illustration: FRANCISCO PIZARRO, CONQUEROR OF PERU AND FOUNDER OF
LIMA.]

Valverde thus gave the first signal of attack; Pizarro then waved a
white kerchief and the gun boomed its fateful command from the fortress.
In an instant the Spaniards poured into the plaza, yelling their
battle-cry, while the guns kept up a deafening noise; the horses plunged
into the terror-stricken ranks of the Inca’s attendants, trampling
hundreds under their iron hoofs; both infantry and cavalry wrought havoc
with their swords, and the plaza—a few minutes before brilliant with the
splendor and gaiety of a royal train, come to honor the stranger and
accept his proffered hospitality—became a scene of carnage and death, a
horrible spectacle, though welcome enough to the treacherous host, whose
invitation had been given with this very object in view.

It is not strange that panic seized the followers of Atahuallpa when the
Spaniards made their murderous onslaught, unaccustomed as the Indians
were to the sound and smoke of the cannon, the sight of rearing,
prancing steeds, and the glitter of the long, sharp swords, which the
bearded “palefaces” used with such deadly effect. The Inca’s nobles
pressed closely around the royal litter, sheltering their beloved
sovereign until cut down by the assailants, when their places were
immediately filled by others. His faithful attendants sought to force
back the cavaliers by clinging to their saddles and trying to unhorse
them, never loosening their grip until the cruel blade of the Spaniard
put an end to their pitiful efforts. So persistently did the brave
nobles interpose themselves between the enemy and the sacred person of
their sovereign that it seemed impossible for Pizarro’s men to secure
their prize; and some of his officers would have taken the Inca’s life
to prevent his eluding them, had it not been for Pizarro’s command, “Let
no one harm the Inca on peril of his life!” Finally, as the fierce
struggle closed in around the royal palanquin, and one after another of
those who bore it aloft was slain, it was overturned, the monarch being
saved from a fall by Pizarro, who caught him in his arms.

What irony of fate! The stranger whom Atahuallpa had permitted to come
to the very threshold of his royal palace, without offering any
hindrance; who had declared his mission to be one of peace, and had
offered the service of his arms against the royal enemies; who had
invited the Inca to eat at his table, a courtesy to which the monarch
responded in a truly royal spirit by presenting himself unarmed to
accept the hospitality;—this stranger had first insulted him through the
mouth of his priest; had then attacked the invited guest, who was
entirely defenceless; had turned all the force of unfamiliar arms
against a panic-stricken multitude and needlessly butchered them; and,
finally, had made the monarch his prisoner by catching him in his arms,
as a Spaniard’s sword pierced the heart of the monarch’s last faithful
protector!

The sequel to the Inca’s capture is well known. Apparently, the
unfortunate victim did not at first comprehend what had passed, and it
is related by one of the conquerors that, when conveyed to the royal
_tambo_, where he dined with Pizarro the evening of the tragedy,
according to his promise, the prisoner even congratulated his captor on
the cleverness with which his royal person had been seized in the midst
of his troops. That the disappearance of their sovereign within the
Spanish quarters should have sufficed to effect the conquest of his
empire, is easily explained in the very nature of his authority, which
was so absolute that it governed the spirit as well as the mind and
person of every creature in his realm. The Inca a prisoner? It was as if
Deity had condescended to permit his omnipotence to be dominated; but
how, then, could the puny effort of mere mortals avail, where the Son of
the Sun himself had not resisted? When his soldiers learned that their
leader no longer commanded them, the effect of such an incomprehensible,
incredible, and to them, impossible, situation overwhelmed them with awe
for the white man, whom they looked upon as superhuman and invincible.

The great majority of the royal army was still on the march from Cuzco
at the time of Atahuallpa’s capture; and not only was there no immediate
possibility of his rescue, but there was great fear in the Inca’s mind
lest his half-brother, Huascar, should escape from prison and ascend the
throne of Cuzco. He felt the necessity of obtaining his freedom at all
costs and as speedily as possible. The astute monarch had not been slow
to observe that the sight of gold produced a marvellous effect on the
Spaniards, whose eyes glistened with greed when some of their party,
sent to pillage the royal encampment, returned with gold and silver
plate, and precious ornaments taken from the bodies of the nobles who
had perished in the massacre.

The Inca took the first opportunity to appeal to Pizarro’s ruling
passion by promising the Conqueror that if he would give him his freedom
the Spaniards should have all the gold they wanted. Standing up in his
prison and marking a place on the wall as high as he could reach, he
said that he would fill the room up to that height with gold, and the
adjoining room he would fill twice with silver as the price of his
ransom. The brother of the Conqueror relates in his memoirs that the
apartment to be filled with gold was thirty-five feet long by eighteen
feet wide! Pizarro accepted Atahuallpa’s offer, though there is nothing
to indicate that he held himself in any way bound to fulfil his part of
the contract. Perfidious to the last degree in every relation of his
life, it is not strange that he should have shown toward a captive and a
heathen the same disregard for his word as appeared in his dealings with
his best friends. Meantime he set to work assiduously, with the help of
Father Valverde, to prove to Atahuallpa that the faith of the Spaniards
was the only true faith; and his unanswerable argument was that the
Spaniards’ God had brought victory to his children, while the Inca’s
deity had deserted his own in their hour of need;—which the Inca found
it impossible to deny.

[Illustration: GENEALOGY OF FRANCISCO PIZARRO, CONQUEROR OF PERU.]

While the Inca’s couriers were collecting the royal treasure from the
temples and palaces of Tahuantinsuyo and despatching it from the four
quarters of the empire to Cajamarca, the imprisoned monarch continued to
live in the Spanish quarters, free to go about in the apartments that
had been reserved for his use, and treated with the respect due to his
rank, though always under strict surveillance. He was allowed the
society of his wives, and could receive visits from his nobles who came
daily to bring presents and to offer condolence. Through these
messengers he learned that Huascar was plotting to escape from captivity
and secure the throne, and that he had sent word to the Spaniards
promising to raise a greater ransom than Atahuallpa could obtain, who
had never been in Cuzco and knew nothing of its wealth. These reports
both angered and alarmed the Inca, who knew very well that his
half-brother’s claim to the throne would meet with a powerful support
among his former subjects if Huascar should gain his freedom, and that
such an event would of itself suffice to convince the whole nation that
Huascar was favored by their deity, and that Atahuallpa’s captivity was
the just punishment of a usurper. This condition of affairs was
eminently satisfactory to Pizarro, who saw that whichever sovereign he
chose to support must be in reality his vassal, and that between the two
he was likely to collect into his coffers all the treasures of Peru.

Although the historians of the Conquest generally agree that Huascar met
a violent death by the secret orders of his brother, the chroniclers of
that time were, as a rule, not impartial in their statements, and it is
known only that Huascar was assassinated,—by whose order is not certain.
Pizarro was enraged when he heard of Huascar’s death and immediately
charged Atahuallpa with the crime. A stronger guard was placed to watch
the Inca’s apartments and he was under constant suspicion. Pizarro held
him responsible also for delays in the arrival of the royal treasure,
until the Inca, to prove his good faith, offered to provide safe-conduct
to any officers the Spaniards might send to superintend its collection
and transport. Emissaries of Pizarro were despatched to Pachacámac and
Cuzco, which Atahuallpa indicated as the chief repositories of wealth,
though the messenger found Pachacámac already dismantled of its
treasures when he arrived; what became of its gold has never been
learned. The soldiers commissioned to collect the treasures of Cuzco
returned with marvellous stories of its wealth and magnificence. They
found the Temple of the Sun “literally covered with plates of gold,”
which they stripped from its sacred walls in such a frenzy of avarice
that the natives were disgusted beyond measure. The historian Herrera
says they secured seven hundred gold plates, ten or twelve inches in
diameter, besides other rich ornaments, though they did not accomplish
their mission so successfully as they would have done had they been less
brutal and rapacious in their conduct.

Pizarro would have liked to go on to Cuzco himself and secure possession
of the Imperial capital; but, as the reinforcements that Almagro was to
bring from Panamá had not arrived, he feared to undertake such a
journey, protected only by a small force, especially as the safe-keeping
of the Inca would require a powerful guard when passing through the
heart of his populous dominions. While the emissaries were on their way
to get the Inca’s treasure, Almagro reached Cajamarca with one hundred
and fifty men and fifty horses, besides plenty of ammunition; and
Pizarro at once began to lay his plans for the proposed march to Cuzco.
Meanwhile the pile of gold was rapidly increasing, and though it did not
reach the promised height, it amounted, in all, to more than fifteen
million dollars in value, and was the largest ransom that had ever been
paid by a sovereign captive. In spite of the impatience of his jailers,
Atahuallpa had accomplished wonders in the prompt collection of such a
vast treasure, brought from long distances, over mountains and across
rivers, by the most primitive method of transport. He was beginning to
feel very happy in his fancied security, and looked forward to
completing his ransom without the slightest difficulty, when events
occurred, or were reported to have occurred, which gave Pizarro an
excuse to claim the ransom without releasing his prisoner,—indeed, while
condemning him to a cruel death.

As the magnificent treasure of gold and silver grew before the eyes of
the Conquerors, their avarice became too strong to be controlled by any
sentiment of justice or consideration, and they refused to wait longer
for a division of the spoils; they urged many reasons why the gold
should be melted down and divided without further delay, and at last
Pizarro gave the necessary orders. It was agreed that some rare and
beautiful vases, utensils of the temples, ornaments, and curious
imitations of plants and animals, should be sent, intact, as part of the
royal fifth, to the Spanish sovereign. When the division of the prize
was made, Pizarro kept the Inca’s gold throne, and became the possessor
of nearly a million dollars as his share of the treasure. His brother
received one-fourth of this amount and Hernando de Soto much less.

[Illustration: CAJAMARCA, WHERE ATAHUALLPA WAS SEIZED AND EXECUTED BY
PIZARRO’S ORDER.]

When the Inca saw that the price of his ransom had been seized and
divided among his captors he very naturally demanded his freedom. But
Pizarro placed expediency far above justice, and he had no intention of
releasing the captive. On the other hand, he was anxious to get on to
Cuzco. He did not want to be burdened with the care of the royal
prisoner, if it could be avoided. What was to be done? To one of
Pizarro’s character, the end in view was of so much greater importance
than the means by which he gained it, that it is not likely he would
have found difficulty in securing a pretext for the execution of
Atahuallpa, if necessary. But, again good fortune brought to his hand
the weapon for his destructive purpose, in the form of rumors to the
effect that the friends of Atahuallpa were planning an attack on the
Spaniards, and that a large force was encamped only a hundred miles from
the city, ready to march on them, seize their gold and carry off the
Inca. The unfortunate prisoner was at once charged with being the author
of the plot, which probably originated in Pizarro’s own fertile brain.
There was a vehement demand for his execution. Pizarro appeared
unwilling to take such extreme measures and sent Hernando de
Soto—Atahuallpa’s best friend in the camp—at the head of an expedition
to find out the truth about the rumored uprising. While De Soto was
absent, Pizarro “consented to listen to the importunities of his
soldiers,” held a trial in which the Inca was proved guilty of having
usurped the throne; of assassinating his brother; of fraud, idolatry,
polygamy, and, finally, of attempting to excite an insurrection against
the Spaniards. He was condemned to be burnt to death that very night in
the plaza; but, in case that he embraced the Christian religion and was
baptized, his sentence would be commuted to death by strangulation.

The annals of crime furnish no more odious example of heartless cruelty
than is shown in Pizarro’s treatment of the Inca sovereign. Not in a
single instance did the Conqueror keep faith with the Indian emperor,
whom he seized by fraud, persecuted on the flimsiest pretexts, and
murdered without a shred of evidence against the condemned. Is it any
wonder that when the news of the verdict was conveyed to Atahuallpa he
was overwhelmed by the horror of it, and exclaimed: “What have I done
that I should meet with such a fate?” It is said that Pizarro was
visibly affected when the doomed prince turned to him, and said: “And
from your hands, too—you, who have met with friendship and kindness from
my people, with whom I have shared my treasures, who have received
nothing but benefits from my hands!” But however Pizarro may have been
affected, he did not allow any softer impulse to sway him from
inflicting death by the _garrote_ on the innocent victim of his
ambition.

Two hours after sunset on the 29th of August, 1533, the emperor of the
Incas was led out, chained hand and foot, into the plaza which he had
entered a few months before as the proud and powerful representative of
a noble dynasty. And the mighty change had been wrought entirely through
his too friendly protection of a band of invaders, his too princely
welcome to a treacherous chief, and his too lavish gifts to an
unscrupulous enemy. The ceremony of baptism was performed by Father
Valverde, as the Inca had consented to embrace Christianity rather than
be burned at the stake. It is related that Atahuallpa implored Pizarro
to take compassion on his young children and protect them, after which
he resigned himself to his fate and met death without giving a sign. The
official obsequies were performed the following day, Father Valverde
reading the service of the dead, while Pizarro and the principal
cavaliers attended in deep mourning.

The execution of Atahuallpa did not take place any too soon, so far as
Pizarro’s designs were concerned, for Hernando de Soto returned to
Cajamarca a couple of days later with the news that the whole story of
an uprising was a _canard_ and Atahuallpa was innocent! Great was the
sorrow and indignation of De Soto to learn that the Inca had been
executed; for this brave cavalier was a friend of the unhappy monarch
and had shielded him on more than one occasion when the fierce temper of
the soldiers threatened him with harm. Pizarro quailed before the noble
spirit of his braver and better comrade, and sought to throw the blame
on Valverde, who in turn repudiated all share of responsibility in the
shameful business, saying he had acted only as Pizarro’s chaplain. It
was evident that no one cared to father the fraud by which, under the
name of justice, the Inca’s death had been accomplished.

[Illustration: PIZARRO ON THE ISLAND OF GALLO. FROM A PAINTING BY JUAN
O. LEPIANI.]

The execution of Atahuallpa completed the Conquest of Peru. The
sovereignty of the Inca emperor had been too absolute for its own
well-being, and in the hour of peril, the humble subjects, who had
responded with such perfect obedience to the will of an autocrat, were
powerless to move without his guiding finger, possessing in themselves
neither initiative nor self-reliance, qualities that thrive only in the
free air of independence, under the sunlight of hope. That the despotism
of the Incas was a mighty power, exercised with genius and worthiness,
cannot be denied; industry was the basis of its greatness, and
protection the keynote to its prosperity; every subject of the Children
of the Sun must earn his bread by honest labor, though he was always
sure of being fed. But the very fact that such a despotism could be
annihilated by a mere handful of adventurers, and that, within the space
of a few months, its institutions could fall to pieces and its people be
made slaves to this band of invaders whom they outnumbered by millions,
proves that it was not a system strong enough to hold its own in the
progress of nations. One cannot help regretting, however, that such a
flourishing empire was not permitted to fulfil its own destiny; perhaps
it might have developed, through the refining influence of the national
ideals, from an absolute theocracy to a more liberal form of government.

With the overthrow of the Incas, the land that had bloomed perennially
with the fruits of husbandry became a scene of anarchy and a neglected
waste; the highroads, instead of presenting a pleasant spectacle in
groups of contented farm laborers, on their way to fulfil the daily
tasks that were to bring them both bodily and spiritual reward, were
thronged with heavy-hearted, over-worked, and poorly fed slaves.

[Illustration: AUTOGRAPHS OF THE FIRST OFFICIALS WHO GOVERNED LIMA WITH
PIZARRO.]

As soon as the obstacle of Atahuallpa’s presence was removed, Pizarro
and his followers set out for Cuzco, marking their progress by the
demolition of Inca temples along the route, the seizure of treasure, and
all the outrages which an unrestrained soldiery of brutal instincts will
commit under such circumstances. Everywhere the emblems of the Sun
worship were replaced by images of the Virgin and Child, and the few
efforts at resistance that were made by the terror-stricken natives were
easily overcome by the soldiers of the Cross. An uprising of some
importance took place near Jauja, under the command of the Inca’s
favorite general, but it was quelled and the leader burned at the stake.
A brother of Huascar, the Inca Manco, sought an interview with the
Spaniards and put forth his claims to the throne of his fathers, asking
Pizarro’s protection. As it did not in any way interfere with Pizarro’s
plans, but rather promised to further them, the Conqueror caused Manco
to be crowned at Cuzco, the ceremony being more like an acknowledgment
of vassalage to Spain than the coronation of a royal heir of the Inca
dynasty. However, the outward semblance of royalty counted for much
among the Inca’s subjects, who, at that time, no doubt had very confused
ideas as to Pizarro’s place in the government, and were contented as
long as the crimson _masca paicha_ adorned the brow of an Inca prince.
By this politic proceeding, the governor, as Pizarro was now called, was
able to begin the colonization of the country, though only after all the
temples, palaces, fortresses, and tombs of the holy city had been
stripped of their last treasures,—the amount secured being even greater
than the ransom of Atahuallpa,—was it possible to establish the
institutions of peaceful government.

Leaving Cuzco to be ruled by one of his brothers, Pizarro set out for
the coast to learn the intentions of a newly arrived adventurer, Pedro
de Alvarado, who had been with Cortés in Mexico, and had come to seek a
fresh field for his military prowess in Peru, having heard of the
Conquest and of the enormous booty secured by the discoverers. Pizarro
met Alvarado at Pachacámac, where they came to a friendly understanding,
and spent some time together in social entertainment, after which
Alvarado departed for Guatemala, and Pizarro, who had long realized that
Cuzco was too inaccessible to be a satisfactory metropolis for the new
colonial empire, began to plan for the foundation of a suitable capital
on the coast. He concluded that the neighboring valley of Rimac offered
desirable advantages, and here the site was chosen on the 6th of
January, 1535, the new capital being named the City of the Kings in
honor of the festival of Twelfth Night. The popular name, however, has
always been Lima, a corruption of the Indian “Rimac.” The founding of
the city did not take place until two weeks after the selection of the
site.

The foundation of Lima marks the closing period in the history of the
Conquest, a period in which that remarkable drama of warring ambition
reached a final scene in keeping with the tragic story. When the royal
fifth of the enormous treasure taken from the Inca’s dominions arrived
at the court of Spain, the whole country went mad with excitement over
such a mountain of gold. Charles was overcome with delight and
manifested his appreciation of the great service rendered by Pizarro,
Almagro and Valverde, by giving to the first the title of Marquis with
seventy leagues more of territory southward; to Almagro two hundred
leagues, beginning at the southern boundary of Pizarro’s dominions; and
to Father Valverde the bishopric of Cuzco. Father Luque had died at
Panamá, after warning Almagro to be on his guard in his dealings with
Pizarro, whom the honest priest distrusted from the first. Following his
advice, and profiting by his own previous experience, Almagro had sent
his personal representative to Spain with Hernando Pizarro, when that
cavalier was commissioned to carry the royal fifth to the king. The
Conqueror and his marshal, as Almagro was called, no sooner received
news of the division of their possessions than they began to quarrel
over the limits. Almagro claimed Cuzco in his province of New Toledo,
while Pizarro insisted that the Inca capital belonged to his dominion,
which was called New Castile. Pizarro went to Cuzco, met Almagro and
persuaded him to allow the matter to rest until Hernando should arrive
from Panamá with the documents; the two embraced and swore undying
loyalty to each other, after which Almagro set out to conquer Chile,
while Pizarro returned to the task which gave him more pleasure than any
other, the building of the new capital of Peru. He also founded the city
of Trujillo, naming it after his birthplace in Spain.

[Illustration: A DESCENDANT OF THE CONQUERED INCA.]

Meantime the young Inca Manco had been laying plans for revolt, goaded
to desperation by the insults which he and his people suffered from the
Spaniards. Not only were the temples robbed, the practice of his
religion being forbidden, but gross treatment was shown to the priests
and all manner of outrages were committed. The women of the convents
were turned into the streets to become the prey of a vicious soldiery.
Twice the Inca made his escape, and the second time he succeeded in
collecting a large army, but their arrows and sling-stones made little
impression on the Spanish coat of mail, and only their copper-tipped
lances and battle-axes of the same material served in the fight; these
weapons they used so dexterously that the enemy was forced to retreat to
Cuzco, which the Indians promptly surrounded and set on fire, preferring
to burn their holy city to the ground to seeing it in possession of the
hated conquerors. Their revolt was so determined and persistent that
Pizarro became alarmed and sent reinforcements and supplies to his
countrymen, who were in dire straits for several weeks, shut up in the
half-demolished city, while the Indians held possession of the fortress
of Sacsahuaman and all the mountain passes around. Manco himself
occupied the fortress of Ollantaytambo, which the Spaniards attacked
unsuccessfully, being forced to retreat to Cuzco without effecting his
capture. Although the Spanish arms finally prevailed and the Inca’s
forces were scattered, this proud and heroic prince continued to harass
the usurpers of his kingdom for years, so that his name was held in
terror by the colonists, until he was at last assassinated by a party of
Spaniards to whom he had given shelter in his camp.

Almagro’s expedition to Chile having proved a failure, the adventurer
returned to establish his claim to Cuzco. He was met by Pizarro’s
brother, Hernando, his old enemy, and was defeated near Cuzco,
imprisoned and put to death by the Conqueror’s orders. To his son he
bequeathed the province of New Toledo. But Pizarro saw in the death of
his old comrade an opportunity to unite the two provinces under one
government, and he refused to recognize the claim of the younger
Almagro, which so incensed the veteran followers of Pizarro’s latest
victim that they swore a terrible vengeance on the usurping governor.
Driven to desperation by the apparent hopelessness of their cause, and
eager to avenge the death of their beloved leader—for Almagro had been
the idol of his soldiers, whose devotion he held by unfailing kindness
and generosity—“those of Chile,” as they were contemptuously called by
Pizarro’s men, were ready to commit any crime that would rid them of the
domination of the hated Conqueror. Under the leadership of Juan de Rada,
who, on the death of the senior Almagro, constituted himself the
guardian and champion of the son, affectionately known among Almagro’s
men as _El Mozo_, the conspirators laid their plans against the life of
the governor with consummate skill and daring. Pizarro was warned of
their purpose, which had been revealed in the confessional; but he paid
no heed to danger, and was entertaining a number of friends at breakfast
when the fatal hour arrived.

Whatever may be said of Pizarro’s character, he was no coward, and when
the assassins rushed into his house with the shout “Long live the King!
Death to the tyrant!” they were met by the Conqueror, who, not having
time to buckle on his armor, threw his _capa_, or cloak, over his
shoulder and faced his enemies, sword in hand. After a brave resistance,
he sank down with a fatal wound in the throat. Wetting his finger in his
own blood, he traced a cross on the floor, and was bending to kiss the
sacred symbol, when the _coup de grâce_ put an end to his life. Thus, in
the last moment, the heart of the Crusader triumphed over the instincts
of the gold-seeker!

The burial of Pizarro was attended by none of the pomp and ceremony
usually observed in the obsequies of a great hero; on the contrary, the
interment was hasty and stealthy, performed in fear and trembling lest
it should be interrupted and the corpse dragged to the market place. Not
until more than half a century later were the bones of the discoverer
and conqueror of Peru removed to their present resting place in the
Cathedral of Lima. With the death of Francisco Pizarro the period of the
Conquest ends, as the pretensions of the younger Almagro, who caused
himself to be proclaimed Governor and Captain-General of Peru after the
assassination of the Conqueror, were not recognized by the King of
Spain, who sent Vaca de Castro to coöperate with Pizarro in establishing
peace in Peru, with authorization to take the reins of government in his
own hands in case of Pizarro’s death. As soon as Vaca de Castro arrived,
he assumed the position of governor and captain-general, and, gathering
under his command the soldiers who remained loyal to the king, he at
once marched against Almagro, whom he defeated on the plains of Chupas,
near Ayacucho, in September, 1542. Almagro escaped from the battlefield
and fled to Cuzco, where he was taken prisoner and, by the governor’s
order, was beheaded. About the same time, Bishop Valverde was
assassinated by the Indians of Puná while on his way to Panamá. Thus the
leading spirits in the invasion and conquest of Peru met with a violent
death; Hernando Pizarro languished in a Spanish prison for twenty years,
and Hernando de Soto died in the wilds of the Mississippi forests.

                               CHAPTER VI
                       THE REIGN OF THE VICEROYS


[Illustration: THE FIRST COAT-OF-ARMS BESTOWED ON LIMA BY CHARLES V.]

After the Conquest, all the Spanish dominions in the New World were
divided under two governments, one of which was subject to the Viceroy
of Mexico and the other to the Viceroy of Peru. As representatives of
His Catholic Majesty, and directly appointed by him, the viceroys were
chosen from the noblest families of Spain, especially distinguished for
their services to the Church and the army. These proud grandees
established their court in the colonial capitals on a scale of
magnificence hardly excelled by that of their royal master; and the City
of the Kings grew even to rival Madrid in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries as a metropolis of Spanish fashion and culture.

But the period immediately following the Conquest gave little promise of
peace and prosperity for the colony of Peru. Revolution and anarchy
prevailed even after the ignoble strife between the Pizarros and the
Almagros was ended by the tragic death of the Conqueror and the
execution of the younger Almagro. The firm authority of Governor Vaca de
Castro sufficed to maintain order and tranquillity as long as he
remained in the country, but with the arrival of his successor, the
first viceroy, a storm of revolt broke over the colony with such
tumultuous force that it threatened to overthrow permanently the
authority of the Spanish king in his richest and most valued possession.

Blasco Nuñez de Vela, the first viceroy of Peru, who was appointed to
succeed Vaca de Castro in 1544, is described as a brave, honorable, and
devout man, but arrogant and imperious, utterly incapable of
understanding and dealing with the turbulent spirit of the adventurers,
in whom ambition, avarice, and jealousy were the ruling passions,
fostered by the peculiar circumstances which had governed Peru ever
since the capture of Atahuallpa. It was especially unfortunate that a
man of the temperament and prejudices of the new viceroy should have
been chosen to effect a change in existing conditions, requiring the
most judicious and delicate management.

The harsh treatment to which the Indians were subjected under the
Conquerors was brought to the attention of the King of Spain by a
Dominican friar, Las Casas,—whose benevolent labors gained for him the
title of “Protector of the Indians,”—in a remarkable document,
containing such an appalling record of the wickedness practised against
these helpless wards of the Crown that the king, deeply impressed,
called a council to devise means of ameliorating their condition. As a
result, the Viceroy Blasco Nuñez de Vela was the bearer of strict orders
from Spain to abolish the system of _encomiendas_, by which the Indians
had been made ostensibly the protégés but really the slaves of the
Conquerors, not only their lands but their persons being appropriated as
the legitimate spoils of victory. It is true that, under the Incas, the
people had possessed no freedom, but they had been given no tasks too
heavy for their strength and they had been kindly treated and well
provided with food and clothing; under their new masters they were both
abused and neglected. The granaries which formerly were well filled
after every harvest were allowed to become empty, because tillage was
abandoned for the more profitable labor in the mines; and the llamas,
whose wool furnished the Indian with clothing, were slaughtered so
recklessly that, within four years, more of these animals perished than
in four centuries under the Incas.

According to the royal decree, the viceroy was to declare the Indians
vassals of the Crown, though the present _encomenderos_, or owners, were
to retain their privileges, except in the case of public functionaries,
ecclesiastics, religious corporations, all who, by cruelty and neglect,
had shown themselves unworthy of the privilege, and all who were
implicated in the crimes resulting from the quarrel between Pizarro and
Almagro. On the death of the present proprietors, their Indians reverted
to the Crown. The viceroy, although representing the supreme authority,
was accompanied by a Real Audiencia consisting of four _oidores_, or
judges, clothed with extensive powers both civil and criminal, the
viceroy being president of their council. At the same time the Real
Audiencia of Charcas was appointed to have jurisdiction in Alto Peru and
its dependencies. It was largely owing to the differences which arose
between Blasco Nuñez de Vela and the Real Audiencia of Lima that his
mission was a failure.

The order abolishing _encomiendas_ was received with demonstrations of
discontent throughout the colony. Few of the Conquerors could hope to
retain their Indians under the new law, and they were furious at what
they considered an effort to despoil them of the fruits of their
hard-earned victory. In the streets, plazas, and churches, indignant
crowds gathered to protest against the decree, news of which reached
Peru some months before the viceroy’s arrival. The governor, Vaca de
Castro, succeeded in calming the turbulent leaders by explaining that it
would be the wisest course to petition the Crown asking for the repeal
of the law, and then patiently to await the arrival of the viceroy, who
might be prevailed upon to delay action until the answer to their
petition should be received from Spain. Vaca de Castro was not slow to
recognize that the most powerful friend of the malcontents was Gonzalo
Pizarro, at that time engaged in exploiting rich silver mines in Charcas
(now Bolivia), to whom they had already appealed for protection; and in
a diplomatic letter, he cautioned Pizarro not to be drawn into the
revolt. By his judicious policy, public order was maintained and
preparations were made to welcome the viceroy with the imposing ceremony
due to the highest representative of His Catholic Majesty.

[Illustration: LIMA RESIDENCE OF THE MARQUIS OF TORRE-TAGLE DURING THE
VICEREGAL PERIOD, SHOWING “MIRADORES,” OR BALCONIES.]

The innate love of pomp and etiquette, characteristic of the Latin race,
was displayed in all its attractiveness on such occasions as the
reception of a viceroy; and during the entire period of colonial rule
the arrival of these dignitaries was marked by grand festivities. Blasco
Nuñez de Vela entered Lima in magnificent state, under a canopy of
crimson velvet, richly embroidered with the arms of Spain, and supported
on poles of solid silver, which were carried by officials of the
municipality, dressed in crimson satin robes that sparkled with jewels.
The brilliant procession was met three leagues from the capital by the
Bishop of Cuzco, Vaca de Castro, and the principal cavaliers of Lima,
and on crossing the Rimac River was joined by the Bishop of Quito, the
ecclesiastical council and remaining clergy, while at the entrance to
the city the municipal corporation awaited the illustrious guest. An
imposing pageant was presented as the viceroy, preceded by a cavalier in
full armor bearing the mace of authority, and attended by a handsome
retinue, passed under the triumphal arch at the city gates and proceeded
to the Cathedral, along streets strewn with flowers, while the church
bells chimed a joyous welcome and bands of music made a gay
accompaniment. At the Cathedral _Te Deum_ was sung, after which the
procession moved on to the Palace, where the new viceroy took the oath
of office. He inspired confidence by announcing that he would await the
arrival of the Oidores and the installation of the Real Audiencia before
proceeding with the question of the new ordinance.

When the Oidores entered Lima bearing the royal seal, the city was again
the scene of a grand and imposing display. By order of the king, the
royal seal was received with as much ceremony as attended a visit of his
majesty to the cities of his kingdom. It was placed in a box covered
with cloth of gold, and was borne by a magnificent charger, richly
caparisoned and led by one of the city aldermen in gala dress, while
four other officials in robes of crimson velvet carried above the royal
insignia the canopy of state embroidered with the arms of Spain.

The Real Audiencia was duly installed, and everything went well in the
beginning under the newly established authority, the council having
decided to suspend the ordinance against _encomiendas_ until word should
arrive from Spain in answer to the petition for its repeal; except that
immediate enforcement was made in the case of public functionaries. But,
unfortunately, the viceroy and the Real Audiencia did not long agree on
the policy of government, and their quarrels weakened the prestige of
the colonial authority at a time when all its strength was needed to
cope with the disaffected soldiers of the Conquest, who bitterly
resented the way in which they were thrust aside, now that their
services were no longer of prime necessity to the Crown. Gonzalo Pizarro
saw that he was to have no share in the dignities and honors of the
colonial government, and he took advantage of the quarrel between the
viceroy and the Real Audiencia to raise a large army and march on Lima,
the _oidores_ treacherously aiding him; the viceroy escaped to Tumbes
and marched to Quito, whither Pizarro followed, engaging the royal army
in a fierce battle near that city, during which the sovereign’s
representative was defeated and slain. The victor was then lord of Peru,
and more independent of the royal authority than his illustrious
brother, the Conqueror himself, had ever been; he could raise a powerful
army, could control a large squadron, had at his disposal a million
dollars annually, and his friends guarded the national ports of entry.
He was acclaimed the liberator of Peru and made a grand triumphal march
into the capital, amid the vivas of the multitude, the chime of church
bells, and the strains of martial music. His companions would have
crowned him king; but whether Pizarro vacillated because he knew too
well the fickle character of his enthusiastic supporters, or whether the
moment did not seem opportune for such a step, he never assumed the
purple robes of royalty, though his authority was as absolute as that of
a king.

[Illustration: DOORWAY OF A COLONIAL PALACE IN CUZCO. PERIOD FOLLOWING
THE CONQUEST.]

When the tidings reached Spain that the viceroy had been killed on the
battlefield and that Gonzalo Pizarro reigned supreme in the colony, it
caused the greatest consternation. A policy of conciliation was at once
adopted, the law abolishing _encomiendas_ was revoked, and a priest,
Pedro Gasca, was appointed, not as viceroy, but as president of the
Audiencia, with full power to represent the interests of the Crown in
this difficult situation. Though an ecclesiastic, he was a brave
soldier, added to which, he possessed a wonderful knowledge of human
nature. By his tact he won many of Pizarro’s followers as soon as he
landed at Tumbes, where he appeared clothed in the simple garb of a
priest, with a breviary in his hand and the king’s pardon for all who
would help him to establish peace in the country. His ranks were rapidly
filled with deserters from Pizarro’s army as he marched across the
mountains to meet the enemy, whom he encountered at Sacsahuaman, near
Cuzco, and defeated. Pizarro was taken prisoner and executed. Gasca and
his army then marched on to Lima, where the victor was received with
even greater welcome and rejoicing than had greeted the victorious
Pizarro. But it was not until some years later that the civil wars of
the Conquerors finally came to an end. When Gasca returned to Spain, the
second viceroy, Don Antonio de Mendoza, who had previously held the same
high office in Mexico, was appointed to take charge of affairs in Peru.
He died the following year and the government passed into the hands of
the Real Audiencia, until, in 1555, the third viceroy was named, Don
Andres Hurtado de Mendoza, Marquis de Cañete, under whose judicious and
energetic rule the country was pacified and the authority of the Crown
of Spain securely established. During the administration of this able
statesman the son of the Inca Manco, whose following was great in the
sierra and around Cuzco, made a formal abdication in favor of the King
of Spain, receiving in return an annuity of twenty thousand ducats and
other grants. It is related that when the Inca went to Lima to take the
oath of allegiance he was carried from Cuzco to the capital in a litter,
borne on the shoulders of his faithful subjects, and that he received
the homage of his people wherever he stopped along the route; but the
poverty of his own state and the empty-handed greeting of his unhappy
compatriots made his progress a _via dolorosa_ of poignant significance.
He survived the ordeal only three years, which he passed in melancholy
seclusion. The successor of the Marquis de Cañete, the Count de Nieva,
occupied the viceregal office for only a short time; he was assassinated
by order of a jealous husband. His post was taken by an ecclesiastic,
Lope Garcia de Castro, who, as President of the Real Audiencia,
continued the work of organizing the various political institutions of
the colony. Peru was divided into provinces governed by _corregidores_;
the towns peopled by Spaniards had _cabildos_, or municipal councils,
with _alcaldes_, or mayors, and aldermen; the Indians were governed
through their _caciques_, whose authority was, and still is, recognized
by the central government.

One of the most illustrious of the viceroys, Don Francisco de Toledo,
son of the Count of Oropesa, ruled Peru from 1567 to 1580, and his
rigorous though well-ordered government marked a new epoch in the
history of the colony. He began his administration by making a grand
tour of all the provinces, during which he informed himself as to the
needs of the people and the laws required for their well-being.
Accompanied by the priests Ondegardo and Acosta, both of whom became
celebrated afterward as historians of the Conquest, and having in his
suite an _oidor_ and several eminent personages of his court, the great
viceroy made an imposing progress, being received everywhere with a
welcome fit for a king. Though autocratic in his methods, he was
eminently successful in reforming the political organization of the
country; the _corregidores_, _alcaldes_, municipal police, in fact,
every employee of the government, received positive instructions as to
the duties of his office. He abolished _encomiendas_ and obliged the
Indians to live in communities, in each of which a church was built and
priests were appointed to give the inhabitants religious instruction.
Hundreds of these communities or _reducciones_ were founded by the
viceroy’s order, and built up with adobe houses, straight, though
narrow, streets, _cabildos_, jails, hospitals, and a tract of land to be
held as community property and worked on shares. The viceroy also
established a regular system for the labor by _mita_, or rotation,
required of the Indians, as well as for the tribute they were obliged to
pay from the age of eighteen to fifty; more than twelve thousand
_mitayos_, as the rotation laborers were called, were consigned to the
silver mines of Potosi, then at the height of their production, and
three thousand to the mines of quicksilver in Huancavelica, recently
discovered. The Crown granted ownership of the mines to any Spaniards
who would guarantee to work them and to deliver to the king one-fifth of
all the ores extracted, and the _mita_ was established in order to
supply the necessary labor to work the mines; but so cruel was the
oppression of the unhappy _mitayos_ that, it is said, only a tenth of
them ever returned to their homes, the rest dying a miserable death
under the heavy tasks inflicted on them by greedy and inhuman masters.
The viceroys were charged, on the one hand, to protect the Indians, and
on the other to increase by all means the royal fifth from the mines;
their office was no sinecure.

[Illustration: CHURCH OF THE COMPAÑIA, AREQUIPA, SHOWING EXQUISITE HAND
CARVING.]

Not only did the Viceroy Toledo make laws to improve the Indian’s
condition as far as was consistent with his duty to increase the “King’s
fifth” to the utmost extent, but he also introduced reforms for the
benefit of the Spanish colonists, establishing new schools, hospitals
and other institutions. Social life began to show more distinctive
features in the colonial capital than had been possible during the
turbulent period immediately following the Conquest; the viceroy and
ecclesiastics entertained with sumptuous festivals, and luxurious tastes
and habits appeared among the nobility.

But the zeal of the viceroy went farther than the royal mandate
intended, and over-reached itself in the execution of an Inca chief, who
had assumed the _masca paicha_ on the death of Inca Manco’s son, and
who, according to the viceroy, constantly stimulated among the Indians a
spirit of revolt, which might break out in open insurrection at any
moment. The Inca had refused to consider any offer as the price of his
claim to royalty, and the viceroy ordered him to be seized and put to
death, in spite of the intercession of the bishop, the municipal council
and other notable authorities of Cuzco. When Toledo returned to Spain,
expecting the thanks of his sovereign for the services he had rendered
the Crown in twelve years of arduous labor under the most adverse
conditions, Philip II. greeted the aged cavalier coldly and requested
him to withdraw from court, saying, “I did not send you to Peru to kill
Kings, but to serve Kings.” Yet the Viceroy Toledo has been called the
Solon of Peru, for the wisdom displayed in his government. During his
administration, the colony made wonderful progress in wealth and
culture, and the “royal fifth” was greater than it had ever been before.
The Spanish monarchs apparently did not esteem very highly the
sacrifices made by their discoverers, conquerors and pioneers of
authority, who contributed to the sovereign possessions so handsomely,
by the annexation of a continent, the gift of a houseful of gold, and
the collection of “royal fifths” large enough to pay for building the
Invincible Armada!

During the last year of the Viceroy Toledo’s rule, the port of Callao
was sacked by the English corsair, Sir Francis Drake; and in order to
avoid a repetition of such a catastrophe, the viceroy fitted out ships
and sent his pilot Sarmiento to explore the Pacific Coast as far as the
Strait of Magellan; Sarmiento recommended the fortification of the
Strait and the establishment of a colony, for which preparations were
being made at the time of Toledo’s return to Spain. Upon his departure,
Don Martin Enriquez, a former viceroy of Mexico, was appointed to the
vacant post, but he died after two years, the affairs of the colony
being left in charge of the Real Audiencia of Lima for two years, when
the Count del Villar Don Pardo was named viceroy.

The expedition which was sent out by Spain to form a colony on the shore
of the Strait of Magellan, encountered a fierce tempest and only
eighteen of the colonists survived. Their leader abandoned them to join
the first pirate ships that appeared, which were those of Cavendish,
following in the track of Drake, though with less success, as the
Pacific ports were better protected than they had been eight years
before. But if the pirates took little treasure, their departure was
soon followed by the appearance of an epidemic of smallpox, which
wrought terrible havoc in the colony. Whole families and even towns were
destroyed by the plague, the fields remained uncultivated, the cattle
neglected, even the mines were abandoned, the horrors of famine being
added to those of the plague. This was in the year that witnessed the
defeat of the “Invincible Armada,” a catastrophe that brought in its
train many others for the proud monarch of Spain, whose power was no
longer in the ascendant among the arbiters of European destiny, as it
had been when he was crowned king. But, although Peru suffered much from
the plague, the natural riches of the country were so abundant that the
worst effects soon disappeared and prosperity reigned, more flourishing
than ever. The viceroy did all in his power to promote the best
interests of the colony, though his humane laws made him many enemies.
He prohibited the forcing of _mitayos_ to do excessive labor and to live
in unhealthy localities, and forbade the treating of _yanaconas_
(Indians who carried burdens) as slaves. During his administration the
king accorded to graduates of the University of San Marcos in Lima
honors and privileges equal to those of Salamanca, the great centre of
learning in Spain.

The second Marquis de Cañete was appointed viceroy to succeed the Count
del Villar in 1589. He came accompanied by his wife and a large suite of
Spanish nobility. Their arrival marked a new era in the social life of
the capital, which became brilliant with gay functions and the
fashionable amusements of a court. The noble Marquis and his retinue
were not only received with great ceremony under the crimson canopy of
state, but the festivities attending their arrival were of the most
elaborate description throughout the whole colony. The viceroy
established a strict court etiquette, according to the historian
Lorente, giving special instructions “that the women of the court should
maintain the greatest reserve, not receiving attentions or seeking
husbands, and should pay to the vicereine all the respect which court
etiquette demanded.” In harmony with the viceregal grandeur, a royal
chapel was erected in the palace and the religious ceremonies of the
court were observed with imposing formality. The number of _oidores_ was
increased and the Real Audiencia assumed a greater importance, as the
growing prosperity of the colony added to its responsibilities and
influence.

On many occasions the viceroy reproved the arrogance of the clergy, his
high office giving him the authority of vice-patron of the Church; and
he never forgot that his first duty was to his sovereign, whose
coat-of-arms he caused to be placed above the Archbishop’s on the façade
of the seminary, in opposition to clerical opinion, while he did not
hesitate to reprimand even the saintly Toribio for carrying complaints
to Rome. But it was as his sovereign’s Superintendent of the Exchequer
that the Marquis de Cañete made his government memorable. By every
possible means the declining revenues of the mother country were
reinforced from the resources of her colonial treasury, and the genius
of the viceroy was displayed in the success with which he devised plans
for collecting new taxes. Excise duties, the sale of deeds to illegal
landholders and of privileges to office-seekers, extraordinary service
from the Indians, the extension of tribute claims to include negroes and
mulattoes, the income from legitimatizing _mestizos_, who paid large
sums to enjoy the privileges of inheritance, the confiscation of the
property of ecclesiastics who died intestate,—these were only a few of
the sources from which the king’s coffers were filled. The proceeds of
the mines of Huancavelica, which continued to increase in wealth at this
time, yielded an important share of the accumulated wealth, and
Castrovireina, named in honor of the vicereine, whose maiden name was
Castro, became an important mining centre and a valuable source of
revenue to Spain. The numerous exactions of the viceroy met with little
opposition in an age when the most liberal governments did not hesitate
to tax the subjects of the Crown to any extent required by the demands
of the royal exchequer. The placing of restrictions on colonial
commerce, from which foreigners, heretics and Spaniards without a
license were altogether prohibited by the Spanish Crown, was not unusual
in those days, and it was only at the beginning of the nineteenth
century that any American colony under European sovereignty was
permitted to open its ports to the commerce of the world. During the
viceroyalty, Seville was the centre of the commercial monopoly, a royal
board of trade regulating the sailings of ships, their condition, length
of voyage and other matters relating to transportation.

[Illustration: THE KEY OF THE CITY OF LIMA.]

The death of Philip II. of Spain, which occurred in 1598, left the
fortunes of the rapidly declining monarchy in the hands of a weak and
indolent prince, his son, Philip III., during whose reign the colonies
obtained little protection from the Crown, but were continually called
upon to contribute funds to its depleted treasury. The Marquis de Cañete
was succeeded in the viceroyalty of Peru by Don Luis de Velasco, Marquis
de las Salinas, during whose administration the colony enjoyed great
prosperity and wealth through the increased production of the mines; a
new theatre was built in Lima, the streets and plazas were improved and
beautified and many handsome churches and other buildings were erected.
The Count de Monterey, appointed viceroy on the retirement of Velasco,
lived only a year after his arrival in Peru, and was succeeded by the
Marquis de Montes Claros. Like many of his predecessors, this viceroy
had previously held the same office in Mexico. He was one of the best
financiers the Court of Spain had ever sent to the Indies, and so
zealous were his labors in behalf of the royal exchequer that he was
nicknamed the king’s steward. He went himself to visit the mines of
Huancavelica, the product of which amounted to eight thousand two
hundred quintals annually, and he sent _mitayos_ to the gold mines of
Carabaya and Zaruma and to the silver mines of Castrovireina,
Vilcabamba, and Potosí. His successor, the Prince of Esquilache, who
arrived in Lima with a numerous suite in 1615, devoted particular
attention to the defense of the maritime ports, especially Callao, which
he fortified with three cannons and a garrison of five hundred men. He
also organized a navy. But he was a poet and a connoisseur rather than a
statesman and his financial ability was not equal to the demands put
upon it. Although the annual budget of the colony showed its receipts to
be nearly three million ducats, hardly enough remained to meet current
expenses after the “royal fifth,” amounting to a million ducats, had
been sent to Spain and the cost of various improvements effected by the
viceroy had been paid. His court was, however, distinguished for its
brilliancy and culture, and he entertained many noted scientists and
litterateurs. During his rule, several copies of celebrated paintings,
and even some masterpieces, were purchased to adorn the churches of
Peru.

[Illustration: DOORWAY OF A CHURCH IN AREQUIPA, BUILT DURING THE
COLONIAL PERIOD.]

The constant drain put on the resources of Peru by the Spanish kings
during the entire period of the viceroyalty could have been supported
only by a country of inexhaustible wealth and a people of long-suffering
loyalty. Each successive viceroy came to his office with instructions to
increase the king’s revenues, while the protection and aid from the
mother country diminished as its demands grew more urgent and arrogant.
Philip III. died in 1621 and Philip IV. ascended the throne, naming as
viceroy of Peru the Marquis de Guadalcazar, a descendant of _El Gran
Capitan_. During his administration and that of his successor, the Count
de Chinchon, the demands of the court were so excessive that one wonders
the colonists did not rebel against the extortions. The taxes were
doubled, the sale of offices and privileges was increased, donations
were solicited, duties were placed on vicuña wool, salaries were
reduced, expenditures curtailed, and all manners of means resorted to in
order to raise the sum required by the King of Spain for his fruitless
enterprises and his extravagant pastimes; for although new mines were
discovered in Cerro de Pasco and Cailloma, Potosí and Huancavelica began
to show symptoms of decline, owing to the primitive and wasteful mining
system employed.

The name of the Count de Chinchon is associated with the important
discovery of quinine. His countess, who suffered from malarial fever,
was cured by using a remedy that one of the _corregidores_ had received
from the Indians, a preparation made from the bark of a tree, and now
popularly known as Chinchona bark. It is said the Indians had known its
merits from time immemorial. The Count de Chinchon returned to Spain in
1640, and the Marquis de Mancera, of the illustrious family of Toledo,
occupied the throne of the viceroys in Lima for the nine years
following, during which he gave to Peru the best squadron in the Pacific
and protected Buenos Aires, Paraguay, and southern Chile from invasion
by building strong fortifications and providing weapons of defence. His
successor was the Count de Salvatierra, formerly viceroy of Mexico,
during whose administration the capital was beautified by many
improvements. The handsome bronze fountain which still adorns the plaza
in front of the government palace was erected by his order. He died in
Lima soon after the arrival of the viceroy named to succeed him, the
Count de Alva. The funeral of the Count de Salvatierra was an occasion
of magnificent ceremony, the widowed countess observing with great pomp
and formality the strictest court etiquette of mourning.

The Count de Alva and his successor, the Count de Santisteban, gave
especial attention to the reform of laws affecting the Indians employed
in the mines. The discovery of new mines at Laicacota, in the province
of Puno, which produced one hundred thousand dollars in one night,
revived abuses that had been quelled in other districts, and resulted in
terrible fighting and bloodshed. In the midst of these conditions news
was received that Philip IV. was dead and that his son Charles II. had
ascended the throne. A few months later the Count de Santisteban died
and the pious Count de Lemos, who is said to have lacked only the frock
to make him a perfect Jesuit, was appointed viceroy of Peru. He came,
accompanied by his wife and two children, with a retinue worthy of one
of the royal families of Europe, both the count and countess being
descendants of Pope Alexander VI. When the viceroy made his official
entry, the keys of the city were presented to him on a gold salver, and
he received a gold-headed staff encrusted with diamonds, that cost five
thousand dollars. The triumphal arch through which he passed was made
entirely of silver plate, and the space beneath it was paved with five
hundred and fifty bars of silver, worth more than a million dollars.
During an absence of six months, which the count spent in Alto Peru, the
countess ruled as vicereine, her sagacity and energy being called into
requisition on more than one occasion during that time. The greatest
labor of the viceroy was devoted to the interests of the Church, and the
religious festivals held during his administration were of surpassing
pomp and splendor. Not even the gorgeous display that attended a royal
progress under the Inca dynasty rivalled in magnificence the processions
of the Virgin in Lima, held by order of the Count de Lemos. His
successor, the Count de Castellar, viceroy of Peru from 1674 to 1678,
possessed little of the temperament of a _religieux_, though he was an
experienced statesman and an able financier; during the four years of
his government he secured for the treasury of Lima twelve million
dollars, and sent seven million dollars to Spain.

As the wealth and importance of the viceroyalty increased, the Court of
Spain sent representatives to the colonial capital whose rank and
previous services to the Crown entitled them to the most exalted
position in the realm, next to that of the sovereign himself; the salary
of a viceroy was seventy thousand dollars, his official income being
double that amount from various other sources. The Duke de la Palata and
Prince of Masa, who succeeded the Count de Castellar, had held high
offices of state for thirty years prior to his appointment as Viceroy of
Peru. He belonged to the royal house of Navarre and had been a member of
the council of regency during the minority of Charles II. of Spain. With
such prestige and renown, it was to be expected that his reception in
the colonial capital would be of the most magnificent description. The
chronicles of the period state that the noble duke was welcomed with
such pomp and splendor as his royal master might have envied, the street
along which he was conducted to the palace being paved with ingots of
silver, while the triumphal arch through which he made his entry to the
city was supported on silver pillars. The robes of the high
functionaries who received the viceroy and his suite sparkled with
costly jewels, and in the Cathedral and the palace enough gold and
silver were displayed to pave another _calle_. And all this wealth
existed in spite of the millions sent annually to Spain, and the
misfortunes the colony had suffered from time to time in consequence of
interruptions in the working of the mines, epidemics, earthquakes, and
attacks from filibustering expeditions, that increased as the precious
galleons of Spain were more and more heavily laden with gold and silver
to attract their cupidity.

The Duke de la Palata spent the first years of his viceroyalty in
resisting the powerful attacks of a party of a thousand filibusters who
arrived on the Pacific Coast with a fleet of ships under the command of
a Flemish captain named Davis. The viceroy sent a squadron of six ships,
provided with one hundred and sixteen cannons and abundant ammunition,
to disperse them, and when their scattered forces formed in groups and
sacked the ports of Guayaquil, Paita, Pisco, Arica, and others, the duke
sent out additional ships, a squadron of volunteers formed of merchants
and capitalists gave their aid to the royal authorities, and the enemy
was completely vanquished and driven from the coast. In order to be
secure against disasters from future attacks, a wall was built around
the cities of Lima and Trujillo, by order of the viceroy. The wall of
Lima covered about six miles in extent, and had five bastions, and six
gates, the work having been completed in three years. In the year 1687 a
disastrous earthquake visited Lima, causing the destruction of many
edifices and the loss of some lives. The Cathedral was destroyed, and
the damage to property was tremendous. But the city recuperated with
astonishing rapidity and was soon as gay as ever.

[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO A COLONIAL INN, CUZCO.]

The question of rebuilding the Cathedral led to a clash of opinion
between the viceroy and the Archbishop of Lima, the latter refusing to
employ any of his enormous revenues in the work. The viceroy had a
powerful enemy in the archbishop, who had held the office of viceroy
during the three years that elapsed between the departure of the Duke de
Castellar and his own arrival, and the quarrels of these two great
dignitaries furnished abundant material for scandal and gossip in the
gay capital. Lorente, who has given a graphic and charming description
of social life under the viceroys, relates several amusing incidents. On
one occasion, during a great national fiesta, when the duke was
witnessing the bull fight from the viceregal box, under the crimson
canopy of state, it was called to his attention that the Archbishop of
Lima sat under a crimson canopy also; the duke at once sent him word
that that honor was exclusively reserved for the viceroy of His Catholic
Majesty, and the archbishop was obliged to retire from the scene. The
state coach, drawn by six horses, which presented an imposing spectacle
of luxury in those days, was another object of envy to the eminent
ecclesiastic, who realized that as vice-patron of the church his rival
exerted an authority which otherwise could not have been claimed by the
viceroy. But the archbishop possessed great power and used it
effectively in thwarting the viceroy’s plans for various reforms, though
the administration was marked by consistent and resolute efforts to
improve the condition of the colony. The Real Audiencia was enabled to
exercise its authority with greater freedom, and the entire country was
brought under a more systematic order of government.

The death of Charles II. of Spain, which took place in 1700, was the
occasion of impressive mourning ceremonies throughout the vast empire
over which the House of Austria had maintained its sway for nearly two
centuries. The Duke de la Palata had died ten years before at Panamá,
where he was attacked with yellow fever while on his way to Spain, and
his successor, the Count de la Monclova, a nephew of the Cardinal
Portocarrero, had already won the clergy of the colony to his support
and coöperation by his protection and liberal donations. He was greatly
beloved and esteemed, and remained in Peru as viceroy after the fall of
the Austrian dynasty and the accession of the House of Bourbon in the
person of Philip V., grandson of Louis XIV. of France; his government
was marked by tolerance and the encouragement of social and commercial
development throughout the colony.

[Illustration: ONE OF THE COLONIAL PALACES OF AREQUIPA, BUILT TWO
CENTURIES AGO.]

Five viceroys, two of whom were ecclesiastics, governed Peru during the
reign of Philip V.; they made a determined fight against the evils of
contraband trade, which had grown to enormous proportions, but their
efforts met with little success. The Marquis de Torre-Tagle and Don
Angel Calderon, two wealthy Limeños, fitted out warships at their own
cost to fight the Dutch contrabandists, and took rich prizes; but
although the viceroys punished with great severity all who were
captured, the traffic seemed to increase rather than diminish. In the
meantime, the mines continued to yield great treasure, four million
dollars being coined annually. During the government of the Marquis de
Villagarcia, who was viceroy from 1736 to 1745, the royal fifth was
reduced to a tenth, and colonial commerce was stimulated by the service
of registered vessels that sailed _via_ Cape Horn. Many comforts and
luxuries, which had previously been too expensive for any but the
wealthiest colonists to afford, now appeared in the markets of Lima; the
houses began to be better furnished, and the _calèche_,—a two-wheeled
vehicle, drawn by one horse, on which the coachman rode,—gave place to
the coach and pair. The viceroyalty of Santa Fé was separated from that
of Peru in 1740.

Peru was enjoying the blessings of peace and progress under the rule of
the Viceroy Velasco, Count de Superunda, when a terrible calamity befell
the gay capital: its seaport, Callao, being completely destroyed, and
Lima reduced to the most deplorable condition by an earthquake which
occurred on the 28th of October, 1746. The palace, the university, the
cathedral, the mint, and the municipal buildings, sixteen colleges,
thirty-six convents, and seventy churches, as well as hospitals, and
more than twelve thousand homes were destroyed in Lima; while Callao was
totally submerged with its five thousand inhabitants. The historian of
this dreadful catastrophe relates that the earth rocked and tossed like
a ship in a storm. The clergy took advantage of the opportunity to
preach against the worldliness and luxury of the pleasure-loving people
of Lima; and for weeks society did penance for its sins by fastings and
mortifications. Through the active energy of the viceroy, the capital
was rapidly rebuilt, less than twelve years being required in the
reconstruction of the Cathedral, which it had taken nearly a century to
build originally. Callao was also rebuilt and the town of Bellavista,
which lies between the capital and the port, was founded. The viceroy
had the satisfaction of seeing Lima once more a gay and prosperous city,
the centre of luxury and fashion, the metropolis toward which gravitated
all the wealth of a colony whose resources were no longer confined to
the product of its mines, but began to be derived from agriculture and
other industries.

[Illustration: A COLONIAL AQUEDUCT.]

While the enthusiastic patriots of North America were planning a
revolution that was to bring independence to the colonies of New
England, and to encourage throughout all America that spirit of freedom
which has since grown to dominate the western world, the viceroyalty of
Peru was in the height of its power, under the government of Don Manuel
Amat, who ruled from 1761 to 1775. A military commander of iron will and
severe discipline, he reorganized the army, which consisted of one
hundred thousand men, the navy and the police service of the colony, and
was himself chief of a brilliant regiment composed of the highest nobles
of his court. By his order, the Plaza de Acho was laid out and reserved
for public amusements, such as bull fights, ball games, etc.; the
beautiful Paseo de Aguas was also built during his administration and
became the favorite promenade of fashionable society. It is said that
the Paseo was constructed to please the Pompadour of his merry court,
who was known in the scandals of the viceroyalty—and there were many—as
_La Perricholi_.

It has been said that the first blow in the battle for the independence
of the South American colonies was struck by the hand of the monarchy
itself, when the order was given to expel the Jesuits from the Spanish
possessions, in 1767. It was shortly after this event that the old-time
enmity between _Vascongado_ and _Vicuña_ began to reappear in their
descendants, the Spanish authorities and the Creole students of the
University of San Francisco Javier,—years before the first patriots
announced their campaign. According to some authorities, the revolution
was fostered by the Jesuits, who resented as an injustice the edict
issued against them, and helped to sow the first seeds of republicanism
in the minds of the South American subjects of Spain. In Lima, the
centre of colonial power, there was little more than a rumor of the
discontent that had developed out of the quarrels between _criollos_
(Spanish-Americans) and _chapetones_ (Spaniards) in Potosí and Sucre; at
the time of the Jesuits’ banishment, Lima was apparently happy in the
enjoyment of peace and plenty. The capital was constantly becoming
richer and more attractive with its brilliant court functions, its gay
carnivals, its fashionable promenades, its theatre, balls and splendid
religious festivities. In 1778, during the administration of the Viceroy
Guirior, Amat’s successor, the viceroyalty of Buenos Aires was formed,
embracing the former Audiencia of Charcas.

A final attempt was made in 1780, by the descendants of the Incas, to
regain their lost empire. It was carefully planned, boldly initiated,
and bravely carried forward, assuming formidable proportions under the
leadership of an Indian cacique, who called himself Tupac Amaru, and
claimed descent from the Inca Manco. Goaded to desperation on account of
the iniquities committed against his people by the minor authorities,
who could never be brought to justice, he determined to take the law in
his own hands, and one night seized a ruthless offender, the
_corregidor_ of his community in the province of Cuzco, whom he
overpowered and dragged to his house. After forcing the magistrate to
issue orders that Indians and Spaniards should obey the orders of the
Inca, he hanged the unfortunate official in the plaza and robbed his
house, securing thirty thousand dollars, which he used to promote his
campaign. He collected an army of sixty thousand followers, intending to
march on Cuzco, seize the city and reëstablish the Inca empire; but his
followers were undisciplined, his troops badly organized, and in the
first encounter with the regiments of the colonial army he lost twenty
thousand men. The Bishop of Cuzco threatened with excommunication all
who remained in the rebel ranks, and many leading supporters withdrew,
leaving Tupac Amaru to meet seventeen thousand drilled soldiers in a
battle in which his ranks were thrown into utter confusion, and he was
defeated and captured by the enemy. He was put to the torture of being
fastened by his arms and legs to the saddle girths of four horses, which
were then driven in opposite directions, tearing him limb from limb.
Those of his followers who escaped continued to make sporadic attempts
at revolt and were the first to join the ranks of the patriots when the
war of Independence was launched. But none of the partisans of this
brave Indian possessed his qualities of leadership and their fate is
unknown.

The prosperity of Peru continued under the rule of the viceroys Teodoro
de Croix and Francisco Gil de Lemos, though the influence of the French
revolution was beginning to make itself felt in Venezuela, Alto Peru,
and other districts remote from the capital. During De Croix’s
administration, the viceroyalty was divided into seven _intendencias_:
Trujillo, Lima, Huancavelica, Tarma, Huamanga, Cuzco, and Arequipa; and
an Audiencia was established in Cuzco. The Count de Osorno became
viceroy in 1796, and was succeeded four years later by the Marquis de
Aviles, who devoted particular attention to the military and religious
institutions of the country; during his time, Baron von Humboldt, the
noted scientist, arrived in Lima, and was accorded a most hospitable
welcome.

The immediate proximity of monarchical authority prevented the
development of conspiracies in the capital in favor of independence; but
in Cuzco, Moquegua, Tacna, Huánuco, and other provinces, patriotism,
stimulated by the example of the French and the North American
revolutionists, began to give demonstrations of its strength and
purpose. With the retirement of the Marquis de Aviles in 1806, and the
arrival of his successor, Don Fernando Abascal, the supremacy of the
viceroyalty in Peru may be said to have begun to decline, the government
of the succeeding representatives of the Crown of Spain being occupied
rather in an effort to maintain their authority against the increasing
and, finally, overwhelming force of the patriotic movement, than in
public administration. The viceroy Abascal realized the importance of
making concessions to the now thoroughly aroused spirit of liberty, and
his government was marked by benevolence and conciliation. He founded
colleges, repaired the city walls, built a pantheon, prohibited any
further burials in the church vaults, and was zealous in the promotion
of public enterprises. But the most liberal and devoted efforts could
not stay the hand of destiny. The brilliant court of the viceroys was
doomed to extinction, and the grandeur of colonial aristocracy was to
give place to the simplicity of republican ideals.

                              CHAPTER VII
                      THE CHURCH IN COLONIAL DAYS


[Illustration: ARMS OF THE CATHEDRAL OF LIMA.]

When the devout and fearless protector of the Indians presented his
memorable appeal to the Crown of Spain in behalf of the conquered races
of the New World, he gave expression to the lofty purpose which animated
the true missionaries of the Cross in their labors among the Indians of
Spanish-America. With the courage born of pious zeal, he dared to say to
the most powerful monarch in Europe words which must have jarred on the
delicate sensibilities of a sovereign accustomed only to flattery; but
which, nevertheless, could not be ignored. It is said that Charles V.
was “stricken in conscience” as the venerable apostle of righteousness,
who had devoted more than a quarter of a century to missionary labor in
America, thus proceeded in his arraignment: “The highest Pontiff
conceded the conquest of the Indies to the Catholic sovereigns under the
solemn promise that with their accustomed zeal they would promote the
conversion of those idolatrous people for the greatest glory of the
faith and for the salvation of immortal souls. Such an important
commission, confided to the Crown itself, cannot be delegated to private
individuals. For this reason Queen Isabella was indignant when Columbus
gave his followers a number of the natives to serve them, and she
obliged those who had brought Indians to Spain to send them back to
their own land. The Sovereign Pontiff granted permission to conquer the
Indies for the benefit of the inhabitants, and in no case to increase
the power and wealth of the monarchs of Castile. Moreover, by the
enslaving of the Indians, all that has been gained is the ruin of a
population that covered more than two thousand five hundred leagues of
land. The object of the administration is not to preserve the territory,
the walls, and the houses, but the people. With such an end in view,
Queen Isabella declared in her will that all harm to the natives should
be avoided, and all damages should be repaired; but the death of that
august princess was the signal for the destruction of the Indies!” The
spirit of consecration to a sacred task breathes in every syllable of
the lengthy document, which concludes with the significant sentence:
“The law of God prohibits the doing of evil that good may come of it.”
It is said that the worthy priest exaggerated the amount of evil, which
he depicted in frightful hues; yet the very excess of his vehemence is
to be admired in a cause so just and noble.

Not all the missionaries who accompanied the conquerors joined Father
Las Casas in denouncing the _encomiendas_; on the contrary, some of the
worst abuses of the system were charged against the Christian teachers
themselves. But, as a rule, the priests stood between the unfortunate
Indians and their rapacious masters, and protected the victims of
impatient greed. After the abolition of _encomiendas_, when the natives
were settled in communities, the religious orders, to whose care their
spiritual welfare was chiefly intrusted,—the Franciscans, Dominicans,
Augustinians, and Jesuits,—had frequent controversies with the secular
authorities, the former claiming the right to protect the Indians
against oppression, while the latter declared that this right was abused
in favor of the orders themselves, and that they were growing rich and
powerful through the labor and contributions of their protégés. In a
land where gold and silver flowed out of the mountains in a constant
stream, apparently inexhaustible, it is not surprising that the Church,
which was the controlling power in the state, should profit by such
blessings; though the wealth of the religious communities was gained
through the products of agriculture rather than those of the mines. It
was chiefly under the direction of the Christian fathers that the fields
were cultivated and orchards planted while the conquerors were occupying
themselves solely with the extraction of ores.

The power of the clergy has always been stronger in Spain than in any
other Catholic land, and the national religion has been its most
cherished institution ever since the Visigoths followed up their
conquest of the country, after the fall of the Roman Empire, by
embracing Christianity early in the sixth century. Their ecclesiastical
synods were not only Councils of the Church but parliaments of the
realm, and so great was the power of the clergy at that early date, we
are told, that even the kings prostrated themselves before the bishops.
Then followed the struggle against the Moors, which was first a fight
for independence and later a campaign for conquest, but always a
religious war. It is not strange that the final victory, won after a
crusade that lasted eight hundred years, should have been signalized by
a union of Church and State in the closest bonds, and that the pride of
the people should be concentrated in the religion they had so
tenaciously upheld and defended, and in the military prowess they had so
gloriously vindicated.

The prestige of both the Church and the army was at the zenith when
Pizarro conquered Peru; and as soon as Spain took formal possession of
the country, the Church established its authority throughout the
land,—an authority that dominated all the affairs of the colony, secular
as well as spiritual. The viceroy was, in reality, head of the
government only by right of his office as vice-patron of the Church. The
Sovereign of Spain, as patron of the Church,—an honor granted by Pope
Julius IV.,—reserved the right to provide all ecclesiastical benefices;
the building of churches, monasteries, and other places of worship was
prohibited without royal licence; and papal briefs, resolutions of the
generals of religious orders, or any other decision issued under
ecclesiastical authority required the sanction of the Council of the
Indies to give it value. The viceroy Toledo was the first to be
appointed vice-patron of the Church, receiving the royal seal in 1574.
The bishops of Peru were the chief authorities in their dioceses, the
priests had full charge of the schools, and the missionaries represented
the government in the _reducciones_. A historian of the viceroyalty
estimates that the clergy, friars, and nuns formed more than the seventh
part of the entire population of Lima.

[Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL, LIMA.]

When Pizarro founded the capital of Peru, his first act was to fix the
site of the metropolitan church, of which he, himself, laid the
corner-stone. As materials were scarce at that time and there were few
facilities for such a work, the building was very unpretentious, though
five years were spent in its construction. The ceremony of dedication
was performed in 1540 by Father Valverde, then bishop of Cuzco and all
Peru. According to the chronicles of the period, “the Emperor Charles V.
humbly besought His Holiness, Pope Paul III., to grant the title of
‘city’ to the town denominated ‘of the Kings,’ which had been erected in
the provinces of Peru, and to establish in it a cathedral church.” The
pope granted this request and made Lima a metropolitan see, Fray
Geronimo Loayza being appointed the first archbishop of the colony.
Within a short time it was found necessary to rebuild the Cathedral, and
the work was begun under the most favorable auspices; but so many were
the interruptions, changes of plans, and other causes of delay that not
until 1625 was the edifice completed, the consecration being solemnized
by Archbishop Ocampo, with such pomp and grandeur that the ceremony
lasted from sunrise to sunset. As soon as the Spanish sovereign was
informed of the completion and consecration of the Cathedral, he ordered
that the bones of the Conqueror, Francisco Pizarro, should be
disinterred and removed to the sacred edifice, where all that is mortal
of the great discoverer of Peru is still preserved.

To the construction and adornment of the Cathedral of Lima, Archbishops
Loayza, Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo, and Bartolomé Lobo Guerrero devoted
their talents and their fortune with pious zeal; Archbishop Loayza made
the church a gift of rich ornaments in silver, and a _custodia_, or
tabernacle, of gold and silver, valued at several thousand dollars. The
cost of construction of this magnificent edifice was estimated at half a
million dollars gold, and the interior was a repository of such enormous
riches that their reputed value passes credibility. The balustrades
surrounding the altar,—which was itself a marvel of exquisite
wood-carving,—as well as the pipes of the organ, were of silver, and the
candlesticks, also of silver, were of remarkable size and weight. The
wood-carving of the chancel was not excelled even by that of the famous
Cathedral of Seville. The terrible earthquake of 1746 converted the
great structure into a mountain of ruins, though the present edifice,
which is built on the same site, is an imposing monument of architecture
still, after the lapse of more than a century and a half, and
notwithstanding the destructive effects of time and the elements. It
overlooks the principal plaza of the city, occupying the eastern side of
the square. The Cathedral has five naves, each with nine arches, or
vaults, and along the sides are ten chapels, in one of which repose the
remains of Pizarro. The main altar occupies the centre of the principal
nave, and although not now so rich in gold and silver ornaments as
formerly, it still represents a fortune, being of silver, as are also
the magnificent candlesticks that adorn it. The wonderfully carved
pulpit and chancel, of mahogany and cedar, have survived the numerous
catastrophes through which the venerable edifice has passed, and show
only the wear caused through their use by generations of worshippers.

When Archbishop Loayza, the first incumbent of the see of Lima, died, in
1575, his successor was not appointed until three years later, when
Archbishop Toribio Mogrovejo was named for the exalted office. His
extraordinary simplicity and piety were recognized even in a capital so
gay and pleasure-loving as the City of the Kings, and his name became a
synonym of goodness. Many incidents are related of his charitable acts,
done without ostentation, and solely from brotherly love and Christian
kindness. It is said that one night he was carrying on his back a man
whom he had found wounded in the street, when the watchman called out in
peremptory tones: “Who goes there?” “Toribio,” was the tranquil answer,
the guardian of the law immediately recognizing the good samaritan. The
story of his saintly life and his many works of benevolence reveals the
spirit of self-sacrifice and devotion which characterizes the best type
of Spanish priest. Buckle, in his history of the civilization of Europe,
says, in reference to the long list of holy men who have made Spain
famous throughout the centuries as the land of _beatos_: “No other
European country has produced so many ardent and disinterested
missionaries, zealous, self-denying martyrs, who have cheerfully
sacrificed their lives in order to propagate truths which they thought
necessary to be known.” Not only in the ranks of the humble
missionaries, who penetrated the forests of the Amazon and made their
way through the cañons and across the mountain passes of the Andes to
find their flocks among the “idolaters,” but in the highest princes of
the realm, descendants of kings and lords of proud domains, were to be
found examples of Christian piety and unselfishness worthy of the
reverence of posterity.

[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE CATHEDRAL, LIMA.]

[Illustration: CHURCH AND PLAZUELA OF SAN FRANCISCO, LIMA.]

Archbishop Toribio began his work by learning the Quichua language, so
that he might be the better able to acquaint himself with the condition
and needs of the Indians, whom he protected and guarded with especial
care. As soon as he could converse in Quichua, he started out on a long
journey through the interior of Peru, on foot, accompanied only by two
of his chaplains, and taking a packmule to carry his baggage. His route
led him along the sandy plains of the coast, across snow-clad mountains
and into the forests of the Upper Amazon. As he passed through the
various towns, he visited the churches, monasteries, and convents,
holding services and encouraging the labors of his people, while he
reproved all abuses of power, and used his high authority to remedy the
evils that necessarily crept into a system so vast in scope and
scattered over an almost untraversable territory. In the remote
districts, the devoted pastor visited the little _chozas_, or huts, of
the natives, instructed the inmates in the catechism and administered
the sacraments. Not only did the archbishop make himself familiar with
everything connected with his extensive diocese, but he held two
diocesan synods and three ecclesiastical councils, for the purpose of
considering church matters of importance; he also founded a seminary in
Lima for the instruction of the clergy, which was afterward named the
Seminary of Santo Toribio. While engaged in his apostolic labors in the
north, the illustrious prelate was attacked by fever and died on the
23rd of March, 1606, at the age of seventy. In recognition of his
saintly life and character, the Church canonized him a century later.

[Illustration: CONVENT OF SANTO DOMINGO, CUZCO, BUILT ON THE FOUNDATIONS
OF THE TEMPLE OF THE SUN.]

A contemporary of Saint Toribio is celebrated in the annals of the
Church as the only American Saint of the Calendar, known to Catholics as
Saint Rose of Lima, the patron of the Peruvian capital and of all
Catholic America. She was born in 1586 in the city of Lima and was
baptized by Archbishop Toribio with the name of Rosa. From her girlhood,
she practised the most austere piety, devoting her young life
exclusively to the duties of religion. She was very beautiful, and as
she grew older many admirers sought her in marriage, her refusal being
greatly resented by her parents, who treated the poor girl with cruelty
in order to punish her. At last, however, they were won by her angelic
goodness and permitted her to enter a convent of the Dominican order,
where she remained until her death in 1617. The 30th day of August, her
feast day, is still observed in Lima with great ceremony. The
canonization of Saint Rose was decreed by Pope Clement X. in 1671, and
its celebration took place in Lima during the government of the Count de
Lemos, with such brilliant and imposing ceremonies as the City of the
Kings was accustomed to provide in those days. The pontifical bull was
read in the Cathedral, in front of a marble statue of the saint, which
stood on a silver pedestal and was adorned with priceless jewels. The
following day the image was carried in a procession to its present
resting place in the Dominican church, where an altar is dedicated to
Saint Rose. This church is one of the oldest and most interesting
edifices in Lima, and has been as richly adorned with silver at various
times as the Cathedral itself. A silver altar of Our Lady of the Rosary
which stands at the foot of the presbytery, on the right, is superb; in
the centre of the altar is the niche of the Madonna, of exquisite
workmanship, her rosary being of large pearls. On the feast day of the
Virgin this altar is beautiful beyond description.

[Illustration: CLOISTER OF LA MERCED, CUZCO.]

The Dominican order came into especial prominence in ecclesiastical
matters in Peru during the seventeenth century through its persistent
determination not to accept the dogma of the Immaculate Conception,
which was proclaimed throughout the Spanish possessions by order of King
Philip II. The controversy rose to a great height in Spanish-America,
and processions of thousands of people marched through the streets of
Lima singing in chorus _La virgen fué concebida sin pecado
original_.—“The Virgin was conceived without original sin.” So enduring
was the impression created on the public mind by the controversy, that
to this day the popular salutation in some of the country districts of
Paraguay and Argentina is “_Ave Maria!_” to which the invariable
response is “_Sin pecado concebida!_” It was not, however, until 1854,
as is well known, that the Immaculate Conception was declared a dogma of
the Church, by Pope Pius IX.

The missionaries of Saint Dominic were among the first to come to
America, the venerable Las Casas being of this order as well as Fray
Valverde, Bishop of Cuzco. Las Casas had been named for the diocese of
Cuzco, but he was too intent on his work of reform to desire a benefice,
and Fray Solano of the Franciscan order was appointed to the office. The
Franciscans were prominent during the entire period of the viceroyalty
for their extensive pioneer work in the wilds of America, their devout
pilgrims traversing the southern continent from Panamá to Cape Horn. The
saintly Fray Francisco Solano, who was a contemporary of Saint Toribio
and Saint Rose of Lima, made a journey, barefooted, walking the whole
distance, from Paraguay, through the Chaco—which is still inhabited by
savage tribes, the terror of travellers—and across what is now Bolivia
to the headwaters of the Amazon; his life was spent in Christianizing
the savage tribes of the remote interior, a task much more difficult
than that of instructing the cultured Indians of the Inca’s country. He
died in 1610 and was canonized by the Church.

[Illustration: CHURCH OF SAN AGUSTIN, LIMA.]

The church, chapels, and convents of the Franciscans are the largest and
handsomest in Lima. It is said that more than two million dollars were
spent in the construction of their principal edifice, which was built in
the sixteenth century and reconstructed after the earthquake of 1746,
the interior being richly ornamented; the high altar was encased with
silver and the niche of the Madonna beautifully wrought of the same
material. The cloisters of the convent are supported on stone pillars,
the roof being of panel-work, and, with the beams, exquisitely carved.
In colonial days it used to be said that the four best offices in Lima
were the viceroyalty, the archbishopric, the ecclesiastical province of
the Dominicans and the office of the Mother Abbess of Concepcion. This
nunnery commanded an income of one hundred thousand dollars annually,
the dowry of each nun, on taking the veil, being three thousand dollars.
The order of San Agustin built many handsome churches and convents
during the viceroyalty, and the church of Nuestra Señora de la Merced
(Our Lady of Mercy) is still among the most attractive of the city’s
sacred edifices. There are at present sixty-six religious establishments
existing in Lima, twelve of which are nunneries, each with its
respective church.

[Illustration: CHOIR OF THE CATHEDRAL OF CUZCO.]

The Jesuits, who first came to Peru in 1567, were conspicuously noted
for their scholarship and their great ability as teachers among the
Indians. In every city they established a church and a college; and at
Juli, on the border of Lake Titicaca, they founded a training school for
missionaries, in 1577. Here the students were taught the native tongues,
and were provided with catechisms, grammars, dictionaries, and other
text books necessary for their work, the order having introduced the
printing press into Peru at that early date. The first book issued from
the press of Juli was a catechism, which is now a valued possession of
the National Library of Lima. Among their number were some of the most
celebrated historians of the Conquest, as well as noted naturalists,
geographers, and philologists. Their institutions became renowned,
especially those established in Misiones, in the seventeenth century,
the ruins of which are visited by hundreds of tourists annually. They
accumulated such enormous wealth and their influence was so powerful
throughout colonial Spain, that a royal decree of 1769 ordered their
banishment. The command of the king was carried out with remarkable
secrecy and expedition under the direction of the Viceroy Amat. The
chief difficulty threatened the attempt to arrest the Jesuits of the
capital and convey them on board the vessel which had been sent to the
Peruvian port to receive them. However, the task was completed between
midnight and sunrise, the viceroy himself heading the troops,—which were
divided into four sections, each with a numerous force of infantry and
cavalry—and marching to the four strongholds of the Jesuits in the city,
viz., the convent of San Pablo, the Novitiate, the house of the
_Desamparados_ and that of the _Cercado_. As soon as the door of each
institution opened, the purpose of the viceroy’s visit was made known
and the establishment was placed under guard of the royal troops until
the inmates could be taken on board. The same method was followed in
Chuquisaca, Potosí, and in Chile, though many of the unfortunate exiles
met their death while crossing the snowbound passes of the Andes or in
transportation by sea. Sixty were drowned on the voyage from Valparaiso
to Callao, and the loss of life from shipwreck and other causes greatly
reduced the number who arrived at their destination.

At the time of their expulsion from Peru, the Jesuits were in possession
of the college of San Pablo, the Novitiate, the house of probation of
the Cercado, the house of the Desamparados, and the royal colleges of
San Martin and the Caciques, in Lima; the colleges of the
Transfiguration, San Bernardo, and San Francisco de Borja in Cuzco; the
celebrated University of San Francisco Javier and the royal college of
San Juan Bautista in Chuquisaca; and colleges in Potosí, Arequipa,
Cochabamba, Bellavista, Huancavelica, Huamanga, Ica, Moquegua, Oruro, La
Paz, Pisco, and Trujillo, as well as the missions of Mojos and
Chiquitos, the residence of Santa Cruz de la Sierra and five parishes of
Juli. The landed estates of the Jesuits numbered more than two hundred
at the time of their banishment, and were valued at six hundred and
fifty thousand dollars. It was believed that the order succeeded in
hiding vast treasure, and the government made a persistent search, but
it has never been found, nor is there anything to prove that all their
wealth was not employed in the support of their colleges, missions and
other immense and constantly increasing religious establishments. The
estates of the banished order were sold at auction, and the proceeds,
together with the gold and silver confiscated by the Crown, were used to
pay the costs of their deportation, amounting to half a million dollars,
the surplus, eight hundred thousand dollars, being sent to the King of
Spain. The sacred relics and ornaments of the temples were distributed
among the public institutions, and the collections of books were given
to the University of Lima to form the basis of a public library. All the
revenues of the order reverted to the Crown.

Under the viceroyalty there were five bishoprics subject to the
metropolitan See of Lima, the first having been established in Cuzco and
the second in Lima, at the time of the Conquest, to which were added
those of Trujillo (1611), Arequipa (1612) and Huamanga (1615). In each
diocese the ecclesiastical government was divided into parochial
districts, under the authority of the priests. The religious labors of
the Christian fathers were by no means light during the early days, as
the former subjects of the Children of the Sun, though apparently easily
converted, confounded the worship of God with that of Pachacámac, giving
a most unorthodox interpretation to the dogma of the Trinity and the
Immaculate Conception.

The office of the Inquisition was established in Lima during the
sixteenth century and its victims included all ranks and classes of
society, though the Indians were exempt from its terrors. In the present
day, such an institution as the Inquisition seems a blot on religion;
but centuries ago, it was regarded as an instrument of great power in
keeping the Church free from the contamination of evil beliefs. Its most
earnest and relentless supporters were not hypocrites, bent on revenge,
but enthusiasts, who believed they were justified in taking even the
cruellest measures to protect the faith. The seventeenth century was an
intolerant age, and at the same time that the Inquisition was holding
the _auto de fé_ with fatal frequency, the Salem Puritans were burning
witches, and the Kirk of Scotland was banishing one of its members for
having travelled through a Catholic country.

The viceroy Abascal received the order from the Cortes of Spain to
abolish the Inquisition in the year 1811; and the hall in which so many
judgments had been pronounced contrary to the best laws of human
liberty, was abandoned by the Holy Office, to be occupied in years to
come by the representative authorities of a government pledged to
recognize the right of every man to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness.” The same year that witnessed the abolition of the _Santo
Oficio_, saw the first military gathering of the patriots of Tacna, led
by a Limeño, preparing to join the forces of their fellow colonists on
the tableland of Alto Peru, where they were to encounter the royalist
army.

                              CHAPTER VIII
                   THE OVERTHROW OF SPANISH AUTHORITY


[Illustration: STATUE OF BOLIVAR, LIMA.]

Peru, the centre and stronghold of Spanish colonial power and prestige
in South America for three centuries, was governed by conditions that
did not prevail in the other provinces. The elements out of which the
population was formed were unique in character. The Conquest brought
under the dominion of the viceroyalty a people of such ancient culture
that no period could be fixed as to its genesis, and of an origin so
enveloped in mystery that no certain knowledge existed regarding its
derivation,—a people who had lived for centuries under absolute
despotism and yet had developed a gentle obedience and submission such
as could only exist where the tasks were performed by willing servants
of a beloved master. The crime of the Conquest, so deeply resented by
the princes of royal Inca blood, could not be appreciated in its full
significance by the millions, who were deprived of no rights, since they
possessed none, but were simply taken from the welcome task of tilling
the farms of their “deity-king” and put to the unaccustomed labor of the
mines, under a new master, pitiless in his tyranny and ruthless in
destroying their sacred idols. The saddest effects of the Conquest on
these people appeared when their obedience and submission lost its
refined quality, under cruelty and neglect, and degenerated into
servility and apathy. The Indian’s idea of supreme authority was in
accordance with what he had been taught under a theocratic government
and, therefore, had its fountain-head in religious worship. The Catholic
Church performed its mission in Peru, not only by winning the natives to
the new faith, but by protecting them from unscrupulous _corregidores_,
who abused the law of _repartimiento_—which gave these officials the
privilege of furnishing stores to the natives at a fair price—and forced
the Indians to pay for articles they could never use; many an
insurrection arising from these abuses was stifled through the influence
of the priests, who were the highest authority recognized by the
Indians. It is certain, however, that the former sun-worshippers never
quite comprehended the Christian doctrine, merely adapting their beliefs
to its demands; the Indian of the sierra still salutes the rising sun,
and kneels to pray, as, on his way to Cuzco, he first obtains a view of
the sacred city, or when, leaving it, he sees its sunlit temples for the
last time from the neighboring heights.

While the native element of the population at the time of the Conquest
was represented by a race apparently very old and lacking resistant
vitality, the conquerors and their followers, who constituted the
Spanish element, represented a strong and independent people, who were
still enjoying the noontide of their vigor, having recently won
supremacy against the most powerful enemies by the might of their swords
and in defence of the sovereignty of their faith; the Spanish monarch of
those times received the homage of his people chiefly because he
represented in his person the majesty and glory of the national
religion. The Spaniards were more fervid in the faith than their rulers
themselves; and in the controversies that arose between the
ecclesiastical and secular authorities during the period of the
viceroyalty, the Church could always count on the sympathy of the
masses. As the number of American-born priests increased in the colonial
dioceses, the character of their teaching fostered a sentiment in favor
of the land of their birth, and encouraged the development of a new
nationality, the population of which was composed not only of the Indian
and the Spaniard but of the _mestizo_, of mixed Spanish and Indian
blood, who possessed the predominating characteristics of both parents,
and had a double right to the title of patriot. In the war of
Independence, the _mestizo_ did noble service; and if the _Criollos_, as
the Peruvians of pure Spanish descent are called, proved themselves
splendid generals, there were no better fighters in the ranks than the
_mestizos_, many of whom became distinguished in the history of the
revolution for their courage and endurance, while a few rose to glorious
heights of soldierly valor and left their names engraved on the heart of
a grateful nation. Of the minor elements, the negroes and the _zambos_
(the latter of mixed Indian and negro origin) were the most important,
though it is said the number of negroes brought into Peru did not exceed
fifty thousand altogether.

The only common ground on which conqueror and conquered in Peru could
meet was a reverence for religion and a recognition of the sanctity of
caste. From time immemorial the Indians had lived under this spell, and
the Castilian knew no law above the will of the Church and the
aristocracy, which, in Spain, were long synonymous. It has been said
that caste, more than anything else was responsible for the wonderful
hold Spain had on her colonies. Caste ruled in everything—in religion,
the army, and society—and the masses bowed in willing submission to an
aristocracy, which, if it did not claim celestial origin, at least
became the interpreter of the divine will to a listening nation. It was
this spirit of reverence which made Peru send its shiploads of gold to
Spain, though receiving nothing in return.

[Illustration: PLAZA OF THE INQUISITION, LIMA.]

The great distance that lay between Spain and America rendered it
impossible for the mother country to be closely in touch with the
colonies of the Pacific Coast; and, as time went on, the traditions of
their ancestors became dimmed in the minds of succeeding generations of
Spanish-Americans. Gradually the influence of the clergy and nobility of
Peruvian birth began to be exerted in patriotic measures. In 1750,
schools were placed in charge of the secular clergy, who were nearly all
native Peruvians, with a natural sympathy for the welfare of their
country. The enormous prestige of the home government suffered
successive shocks in consequence of scandals that rang from one end of
the colony to the other, reporting evils practised by the highest
colonial officials, both of the Church and State. The Inquisition, the
banishment of the Jesuits and the declining influence of Spain among the
European powers, all tended toward a weakening of the royal authority;
and though the effects were more perceptible in the provinces remote
from the centre of Spanish power, yet even in Lima, under the very
shadow of the viceroy’s palace, the patriotic spirit found expression.
In the _tertulias_ of the Spanish-American nobility, as well as in the
private councils of educators—who were forbidden to bring into the
country any scientific books, or even the necessary apparatus for
teaching physics, astronomy, and mechanics—the question of national
independence began to be discussed, as early as the period of the French
Revolution. Dr. Toribio Rodriguez de Mendoza, rector of the college of
San Carlos, and Bishop Pedro José Chavez, of Arequipa, were powerful
advocates of reform; and the bishop’s disciples, Luna Pizarro, afterward
Archbishop of Lima, and Gonzalez Vigil, exercised great influence in
favor of national liberty. Dr. Unánue, president of the School of
Medicine, Don José Gregorio Paredes, Don Gavino Chacaltana of Ica and
Don José Pezet, editor of _La Gaceta de Lima_, were among the leading
men of science and letters who declared themselves in favor of
independence, though their reunions had to be suspended in consequence
of the viceroy’s opposition. Two young lawyers, named Pardo and Silva,
were arrested for holding patriotic meetings, the former being banished
and the latter imprisoned for ten years. Secret societies were formed
under the protection of the colonial nobility, and even in the
drawing-rooms of noble dames the forbidden topic was discussed. The
cause had its innocent victims, as all great reforms have
had,—visionaries, whose aspirations were their only crime. José Gabriel
Aguilar, of Huánuco, and Manuel Ubalde, of Cuzco, were put to death in
the plaza of Cuzco, in 1805, for having interpreted a dream to signify
that America would rise up against Spain and that they would be the
chiefs of the insurrection.

The emancipation of the Spanish-Americans, especially in the viceroyalty
of Peru, was not the result of a development out of a condition of
dependence; it came about rather in consequence of a disillusion, which
turned them from the unquestioning allegiance they had always shown
their sovereigns, and led them to demand a recognition to which they had
long been entitled. With the enormous wealth which they had held in
their possession from the time of the Conquest, the heirs to the Inca’s
treasures could have established their independence centuries earlier;
but the same sentiment that made Gonzalo Pizarro’s followers flock to
the standard of Pedro de la Gasca, when he arrived in the simple garb of
a priest, with the king’s pardon in his hand, kept them blindly obedient
to the monarchy for three centuries, until the march of civilization
drew them away from the worship of aristocratic ideals and their
attention became directed to the existence of new conditions which were
already shaping the destiny of modern empires.

Since the accession of the Bourbons to the Spanish throne, when there
were “no longer any Pyrenees between France and Spain,” the influence of
less conservative neighbors had increased within the hitherto exclusive
circles of the proudest aristocracy of Europe. The ideas of the French
liberals had penetrated even into its universities, in spite of the
Inquisition, and had crossed the seas to the colonies of America. There
was something in the atmosphere of the New World which fostered the
growth of liberal sentiments. News of the independence of the North
American colonies, as well as echoes of the French revolution, stirred
the imagination of patriotic Spanish-Americans, and aroused in the
hearts of a few determined souls an unquenchable desire to lead their
compatriots out of the bondage of monarchical rule, that their country
might enjoy the blessings of national independence. For years before
their purpose became generally known, it was nourished in secret, and
when the opportunity arose to proclaim it, the plans of campaign were
quickly matured and put in operation in Alto Peru and Quito, throughout
the viceroyalties of Santa Fé and Buenos Aires, and in Chile, the
patriotic armies finally concentrating their forces in Peru itself, the
first and last stronghold of viceregal authority in South America.

During the government of the Viceroy Abascal, whose administration
lasted from 1806 to 1816, events occurred in Spain which precipitated
the revolution in South America, though under all circumstances it could
not have been long delayed. Napoleon had taken advantage of the debility
and corruption of the Spanish monarchy under Charles IV. to invade
Spain, hoping that the flight of the Braganzas to America would be
followed by that of the Bourbons, and that the sceptres of both Spain
and Portugal would thus easily be placed within his grasp. Charles,
however, abdicated, in 1808, in favor of his son, Ferdinand VII.; and,
in order to carry out his ambitious designs, Napoleon was obliged to
resort to perfidy. After attracting the monarch and his father to
Bayonne with specious promises, he sent General Murat to occupy Madrid
at the point of the sword. All Spain was roused to rebellion against the
invader, but the arrival of Napoleon himself with his veterans secured a
final victory for the French, and Joseph Bonaparte was crowned king,
orders being sent out from Bayonne that the Spanish-American colonists
should transfer their allegiance to the new ruler.

By a decree of Charles V., in 1530, confirmed by his successor in 1563,
the American colonies were authorized, in cases of emergency, to convoke
general _Juntas_ or political assemblies; and in the present crisis,
when the imprisonment of their rightful sovereign had caused the
authority of the Crown to be suspended, this right was exercised, in
order to save the colonies from the yoke of a usurping power. The
leaders of the revolution saw beyond this purpose the greater one, which
was to achieve the final independence of the colonies. But the masses
could not be led into any radical measures against their sovereign. The
influence of the monarchy, which had excited strong religious as well as
political claims to their allegiance for three centuries, was
all-powerful on the minds of a naturally conservative and loyal people;
and it was only through fidelity to their king that the
Spanish-Americans were first induced to take up arms against the
constituted authorities of their country.

The result of the convocation of government Juntas in the various
colonial capitals was a general declaration of loyalty to the banished
King Ferdinand, and a refusal to recognize the authority of Spain so
long as its government remained in the power of the usurper. In Peru,
all the vigilance of the viceroy was employed in stifling the efforts of
the patriots, which became ever more persistent. In 1810, a young
nobleman of Lima, Don José de la Riva-Agüero, the leader of one of the
secret societies formed for the purpose of promoting the revolutionary
cause, was taken prisoner and banished to the interior. Another colonial
grandee, Don José Baquijano, Count de Vista Florida, a poet and
historian, the son of rich parents, joined the patriots and used his
talents in behalf of the cause of freedom, his influence contributing to
increase its popularity among the aristocracy. The Spanish government
having proclaimed liberty of the press in 1810, a patriotic newspaper
was started, called _El Peruano_, but it was immediately suppressed by
the Viceroy Abascal. When the order arrived for the abolition of the
Inquisition, the people went _en masse_ to the building in which the
court had been held, and ransacked its rooms, breaking to pieces the
instruments of torture and destroying the archives.

Royalist troops had to be sent to Quito in 1809 to oppose the patriots,
who had driven out the chief authority and had assumed the national
government; and an army was also despatched, under command of General
Goyeneche, to Alto Peru, where the revolutionists had imprisoned the
president of the Audiencia. In both campaigns the struggle was so
unequal that notwithstanding the heroism and determination of the
colonists they were finally overcome. News of the defeat of the patriots
at Guaqui, on the border of Lake Titicaca, reached Tacna when the army
organized by the Limeño, Don Francisco Antonio Zela, was about to set
out for Alto Peru; and, a detachment of royalist troops arriving soon
afterward, Zela was captured by them and delivered to the authorities,
who condemned him to exile in 1811. The following year, on the 13th of
February, the Independence was proclaimed in Huánuco, but the ardent
patriots who led the movement, Castilla, Araos, and Rodriguez, were
supported only by raw recruits from the sierra and their campaign met
with disaster, the chiefs being put to death.

Cuzco made its proclamation of independence in 1814. The leader of the
patriots was one of the Caciques who had joined the Bishop of Cuzco in
repelling the forces of Tupac Amaru thirty years earlier. He was known
as Mateo Garcia Pumacagua, a brave warrior and an honest patriot. With
him were Mariano, Vicente and José Angulo, Gabriel Bejar, Hurtado de
Mendoza, Padre Muñecas, Luis Astete, Pinelo, and others. Their armies
were despatched in three divisions, one of which, under command of
Pinelo and Muñecas, marched to La Paz, besieged it and took possession.

After the victory of Guaqui, General Goyeneche had retired to Europe, to
enjoy the honors conferred on him as Count de Guaqui and a grandee of
Spain. General Pezuela and General Ramirez were sent to succeed him,
with troops to prevent the Argentine forces from advancing into Alto
Peru; and General Ramirez, who was in Oruro when the patriots entered La
Paz, led twelve hundred men against them, forcing them to retire. He
then passed on to Puno and advanced on Arequipa in time to reinforce the
royalist troops which had been defeated and scattered by another
division of the Cuzco army, under command of the Cacique Pumacagua and
Vicente Angulo, at that moment occupying Arequipa, amid the rejoicings
of the patriotic citizens. The trained hosts of Ramirez were more than a
match for the Cuzco troops, who were forced to retreat, while the
victors entered the city in triumph. Pumacagua and Vicente Angulo made a
desperate effort to recover their position, but when, after months of
marching and counter-marching, the armies met at Umachiri, the patriots
with badly organized troops, many of them undrilled Indians, while
Ramirez had a force of thirteen hundred, well armed and disciplined, the
result of the battle was a total overthrow of the Cuzco troops, who were
pursued and again defeated in an encounter at Azángaro, the captives
being scourged and then set free—after having their ears cut off as a
menace to their sympathizers. The royalist troops found many of these
mutilated heroes among the insurgents whom they overcame in a final
engagement at Asillo soon afterward.

[Illustration: THE SENATE CHAMBER, LIMA.]

The third division of the Cuzco army, commanded by Mariano Angulo,
Mendoza, and Bejar, marched on Huamanga, their progress as far as
Andahuaylas being greeted by the people along the route with
demonstrations of great joy, and the prospect appearing favorable for
the capture of Jauja and Tarma. In Huancavelica they were also well
received, by this time occupying all central Peru and cutting off the
capital from communication with the royalist forces of Pezuela and
Ramirez. The viceroy sent Colonel Vicente Gonzalez to meet them, and a
battle took place at Huanta, the royalists gaining the day after seven
hours’ fighting, during which the streets and suburbs of Huanta were
filled with the dead and wounded. Bejar, Angulo, and Mendoza returned to
Andahuaylas for reinforcements,—which were supplied by the patriots of
Abancay and other towns,—and then prepared to march on Huamanga.
Meantime, word was received of the victories of General Ramirez over the
two other divisions of the Cuzco army and of the advance of his men on
Abancay. Through treachery, Mariano Angulo and Bejar fell into the hands
of the enemy and Mendoza was killed. The triumph of the royalists, who
thus succeeded in putting down a revolution that had extended from one
end of Peru to the other, threatening the very gates of the capital, was
celebrated by condemning to death all the leaders, Pumacagua being
hanged and his companions shot. In this courageous campaign, initiated
by patriots representing every social class—an Indian, _mestizos_, and a
_criollo_ priest—the noble mission had levelled all ranks; the spirit of
democracy had triumphed over caste; the proudest families of Peru
mourned the loss of their sons, sacrificed for the cause of their
country. A brilliant young poet of Arequipa, Mariano Melgar, was shot on
the battlefield, and more than a hundred captives were cruelly murdered
in Puno, among them, Miguel Paschal San Roman, the father of a future
president of Peru.

While the troops of the viceroy were occupied in all parts of the
colonial dominion, the patriots of the capital, led by Francisco de
Paula Quiroz, a graduate of the University of Huamanga, took advantage
of the momentary weakness of the garrison in Lima to prepare an attack,
which, however, was frustrated by the arrival at Callao of the
peninsular regiment of Talavera. The plot was discovered, and Count de
la Vega, who commanded the garrison, was arrested on suspicion of
complicity with the patriots, and imprisoned. Quiroz died in a duel. The
government forces were victorious in all parts of the viceroyalty, news
being received from Chile in 1814 that the patriots had been overthrown
by the army of General Osorio, sent by Abascal to the relief of the
royalists. But that which appeared to be a final triumph of the
monarchy, was but a check in the advance of the patriotic cause, during
which its leaders were able to reorganize their forces and, profiting by
the experience they had gained, to make a better fight than ever,
snatching victory from defeat in one of the most glorious campaigns that
illustrate the annals of modern history.

When the Viceroy Abascal retired to Spain, leaving the government to his
successor, Don José Joaquin de la Pezuela, in 1816, Buenos Aires was the
only stronghold of the patriot party. General La Serna was given command
of the army in Alto Peru, and General Ramirez was made president of
Quito. General Pezuela was the last of the viceroys. Though he arrived
at a moment when nearly all Spanish-America acknowledged the authority
of the Crown, which had been restored to King Ferdinand VII., yet the
astute warrior was in nowise deceived as to the actual condition of
affairs and the strength of the revolution which seemed to have been
dominated by the king’s armies. It was true that the Argentine patriots
had retired from Alto Peru, leaving that country to fight its own
battles under the _guerrilleros_; Chile’s patriotic army had withdrawn
across the Andes; Quito had been subjugated; New Granada had succumbed
to the superior strength of the royalist armies; the cause of
independence had been apparently suffocated in Venezuela, its remaining
defenders having taken refuge in flight; but, though all these facts
apparently signified absolute victory for the government, they really
indicated only the ominous calm preceding the tempest, and it was not
long before the darkness of gathering clouds enveloped the monarchy,
bringing confusion to its ranks, that were to be utterly overwhelmed by
the full force of the storm as it broke over them on the field of
Ayacucho a few years later.

[Illustration: CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, LIMA.]

When the Viceroy Pezuela took command of the government, he found an
empty treasury and general disorder in the various departments of
colonial affairs. The king was disposed to establish rigorous absolutism
in the monarchy, and ordered the severest punishment for the patriots
who had given evidence of liberal intentions; their refusal to swear
loyalty to the usurping Bonapartes was not regarded as entitling them to
any consideration, unless they immediately declared their allegiance to
the Crown, unreservedly. He counted on the support of the Holy Alliance,
and felt sure that the encyclical sent out by Pope Pius VII. on January
30, 1816, to the archbishops, bishops, and clergy of America, obliging
them to promote, by all means, the obedience and fidelity of the
colonists to His Catholic Majesty, would have a speedy effect; the news
of the victories won by his armies against the patriots was especially
favorable to the triumph of absolute authority. But, without funds in
the exchequer and with insufficient means of defence at his command, the
Viceroy Pezuela found himself confronted by a sudden resurrection of the
enemy, stronger and more determined than ever, better organized and
disciplined, and advancing in two powerful hosts, the one from the
north, the other from the south, under the command of experienced and
accomplished generals, whose fame rang throughout all Spanish-America.
The glory of the viceroyalty, which had dazzled Peru for three
centuries, dwindled before the splendor of their deeds of valor and
patriotism.

From the South came the great Ejercito Libertador, or Liberating Army,
which had been organized by General San Martin in Mendoza and had
effected the complete overthrow of the royalist forces in Chile in 1817.
The invading troops were composed of two thousand five hundred men and
twelve guns, protected by the naval forces of the newly inaugurated
republic of Chile, under Admiral Cochrane. Landing near the port of
Pisco, in what is now called Independence Bay, on the 7th of September,
1820, General San Martin issued a proclamation the following day, in
which he declared that the purpose of his army was not to make
conquests, but to liberate a people who had trembled for three centuries
under the barbarous rights of conquest. His orders to the soldiers were
an evidence of good faith and a proof of his soldierly principles: all
robbery was prohibited; all bloodshed, except on the battlefield, was to
be punished by hard labor; any insult offered to the citizens of the
country, whether Europeans or Americans, was a grave offence and might
be paid for at the cost of life itself, according to the circumstances.
In concluding his proclamation the Liberator paid a high tribute to the
courage and humanity of his troops, stimulating their enthusiasm by an
attractive picture of the glories awaiting them as the heroic saviors of
their oppressed fellowmen. This interesting document bore the date of
issue, September 8th, 1820, with the significant words “First day of the
liberty of Peru,” and the signature “San Martin.”

The viceroy hastened to make proposals of peace to General San Martin,
inviting him to a conference for the purpose of agreeing on a basis of
mutual understanding. The invitation was accepted, as San Martin saw in
it his opportunity to gain time, to get into communication with the
patriots of Lima, to learn the state of public opinion, the situation
and strength of the viceroy’s army, and other important matters. The
patriots of Lima had not been idle, though the vigilance of the colonial
authorities prevented them from securing possession of the enemy’s
stronghold; three daring leaders, among them Colonel Gomez, planned an
attack on the fortress of Callao but they were captured and punished.
Riva-Agüero, Francisco Javier Mariátegui, Pezet and Don Eduardo
Carrasco, maintained correspondence with the emissaries of San Martin
and gave valuable information. The conference between the envoys of
Pezuela—who were Count de Villar and Don Hipólito Unánue—and San
Martin’s representatives, Colonel Tomás Guido and Don Juan Garcia del
Rio, took place at Miraflores, a suburb of Lima, and resulted in a short
armistice, but in no agreement of peace; the viceroy proposed the
submission of the patriots to a liberal government under the monarchy,
while the patriots demanded the recognition of their independence.

Before leaving Pisco, San Martin sent General Arenales at the head of a
thousand men in the direction of Huamanga; they were received at Ica and
Huamanga with enthusiastic support, and continued their march to
Huancavelica, Huancayo, and Tarma. The viceroy sent troops to stop
Arenales’s progress, and the opposing forces met near Cerro de Pasco,
the patriots gaining the battle, in which the royalist general O’Reilly
and Colonel Santa Cruz were captured, as well as four hundred soldiers,
who were added to the patriots’ ranks. General O’Reilly received
permission from San Martin to return to Spain, but committed suicide by
jumping into the sea, rather than live under the shame of defeat;
Colonel Andrés Santa Cruz accepted service in the patriot army, and was
afterward president of the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation. Arenales’s
campaign was notable for its influence in winning recruits to the cause
of independence among the inhabitants of the sierra, who were greatly
impressed by the conduct of the troops, especially their respect for
property and human life, which had been ruthlessly sacrificed by the
royalist armies.

The first point of disembarkation made by General San Martin after
leaving Pisco was Ancón, to the north of Lima, where he received word
that Guayaquil had declared its adhesion to the Ejercito Libertador. In
the meantime, many Peruvian patriots had joined San Martin’s army. A
young soldier named Vidal became conspicuous for his zeal and energy and
was promoted to a captaincy for valuable services at this time. Admiral
Cochrane was busily preparing to seize the Spanish frigate _Esmeralda_
in the port of Callao, and on the 6th of November, at midnight, he
perfected his plans, organizing the squadron into two divisions, each of
which advanced on the frigate from opposite directions; the Spaniards
made a heroic resistance but to no avail, as the prize was captured and
carried off to Ancón. This was one of the most daring and brilliant
episodes of the campaign. Soon afterward, General San Martin removed his
army from Ancón to Huaura, near the port of Huacho, about one hundred
miles north of Ancón. Everywhere he was welcomed by the patriots, whose
number increased daily. The adhesion of Trujillo was secured through the
Intendente, the Marquis de Torre-Tagle, his _pronunciamiento_, which was
issued on the 29th of December, 1820, gaining for the patriot cause all
the provinces of his jurisdiction, which included Lambayeque, Cajamarca,
and Piura. Meantime, Arenales was making uninterrupted progress through
the interior, the patriotic Huánuco having issued its _pronunciamiento_
in favor of the cause immediately after the victory of Cerro de Pasco.
In Lima, the viceroy was losing all control of affairs; the royalist
battalion “Numancia,” six hundred strong, joined the Liberator’s army;
the very secretaries of Pezuela were coöperating with the patriots; and
public opinion was divided only between admiration for the Liberator and
contempt for the policy of the viceroy, who, at least, controlled a
larger military force than San Martin, and was better protected.

In January, 1821, the leading generals of the royalist army, distrusting
the purposes of the viceroy and dissatisfied with existing conditions,
demanded his abdication, and raised General La Serna to the supreme
command. General Pezuela retired to Europe with his family. After his
abdication more than a hundred royalist officers and soldiers joined San
Martin’s army, among others, Colonel Gamarra, who became president of
Peru later; and Colonel Eléspuru, who organized the first exclusively
Peruvian battalion in the Liberator’s army. General La Serna, no more
courageous than Pezuela, did not believe that he could offer sufficient
resistance to the advance of the patriot army on Lima, and retired to
the interior, General San Martin entering the capital on the 12th of
July, 1821. On the 28th of July, the date celebrated throughout the
republic of Peru as “Independence Day,” the proclamation of independence
took place in the Plaza Mayor, in front of the government palace; after
the memorable words: “From this moment Peru is free and independent by
the will of the people and by the justice of their cause which God
defends!” the standard was unfolded and the shouts of a joyous people
voiced the sentiment of an emancipated country in _Viva la Patria! Viva
la Libertad! Viva la Independencia!_

The Protector, as San Martin was called, began at once the organization
of a provisional government. He appointed his cabinet, naming as
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Don Juan Garcia del Rio; Minister of War
and Marine, Don Bernardo Monteagudo; and Minister of Finance, Don
Hipólito Unánue. The patriot Riva-Agüero was appointed President of the
Department of Lima. Among the first political acts of the Protector was
the abolition of slavery and of the _mita_. He also proclaimed liberty
of the press and reform in the administration of justice and finance. At
this time Lord Cochrane insisted that his soldiers were impatient to be
paid; and, in order to meet their demands, he went to Ancón where he
seized a cargo of silver ready for shipment, amounting, it is said, to
four hundred thousand dollars. His action was disapproved by San Martin,
and he retired from Peru. Meantime, the royalists were defeated in an
attempt, made under General Canterac, to get reinforcements to the
garrison in the fortress of Callao, which had been left in charge of
General La Mar when La Serna withdrew from the capital. The garrison was
forced to capitulate and General La Mar entered the army of the
Independence. The final triumph of the patriots depended on the capture
of the royalist army, still encamped in the sierra, and the troops of
the Protector were growing impatient over the delay; the political
leaders were occupied with the preparations for the forthcoming national
Congress, which was to meet the following year to promulgate the
Constitution of Peru; in the midst of these conditions, General San
Martin gave the reins of government into the hands of the Marquis de
Torre-Tagle as Supreme Delegate and went to Guayaquil, in order to meet
the great leader of the Ejercito Colombiano, General Simon Bolivar, who
had accomplished for the northern provinces of South America that which
he himself had done so well in the southern half of the
continent,—securing their independence of the Spanish monarchy.

The particulars of the conference between General San Martin and General
Bolivar in Guayaquil are not known to this day; but when the Protector
returned to Lima he resigned the government into the hands of the first
constituent congress, which met in Lima in 1822. This assembly conferred
on him the title of Founder of the Liberty of Peru; gave him the grade
of captain-general; decreed a life pension for him equal to that which
Washington received from the United States; ordered that his bust should
be placed in the National Library and a statue erected in his honor; and
conceded to him in perpetuity the honors due to the chief of government.
A short time afterward General San Martin went to Europe where he died
in 1850 at seventy-two years of age. His patriotism, the constant and
unfailing devotion with which he worked for the realization of the noble
ideal to which his life was consecrated, his honorable principles,
magnanimous conduct, and sterling character, the intrepidity of his
courage as a soldier, the modesty of his deportment as a victorious
leader, place him high above most of the great men of history and make
him worthy of immortality among the best of them.

[Illustration: THE HISTORICAL PALACE OF THE VICEROYS, LIMA.]

The first independent Congress of Peru decreed that the government
should be exercised by Congress, and that a Junta de Gobierno, composed
of three of its members, should constitute the chief executive power.
General La Mar, General Alvarado, and the Count de Vista Florida were
named for the first Junta, General La Mar being appointed its president.
The oath of allegiance to Congress took place with great _éclat_ in
September; the following year the Junta de Gobierno was dissolved and
Don José de la Riva-Agüero was elected president of the Republic, taking
the oath of office and receiving the _banda bicolor_, a band of ribbon
in two stripes, “white and red,” which is still worn by the chief
executive of Peru on official occasions. Congress also bestowed on
President Riva-Agüero the rank of grand marshal. At the same time, the
command of the army was given to General Santa Cruz and General Gamarra
was appointed chief of staff. The president gave especial attention to
the army, and within a few months after his inauguration General Santa
Cruz left Callao for the interior at the head of five thousand troops,
in two divisions, one of which was under his own command and the other
in charge of General Gamarra. They marched into Alto Peru and met the
united royalist forces under La Serna’s generals, Valdes and Olañeta,
but were obliged to retreat before the superior force of the enemy; and
Santa Cruz lost the greater part of his army while making his way to the
coast over the bleak Cordillera, during a dreadful storm. La Serna, who
had his headquarters at Cuzco, had organized his forces in two
divisions: the army of the North, commanded by General Canterac and
stationed in the valley of Jauja, as a menace to Lima; and the army of
the South, under General Valdes, supporting the royalist cause between
Arequipa and Potosí. This was the condition of affairs when General
Santa Cruz left Callao. Soon afterward General Sucre, who has been
called the diplomatic agent of General Bolivar, arrived in Callao with a
force of three thousand Colombian troops. At the same time, General
Canterac was preparing to march on Lima at the head of nine thousand
men. In view of the circumstances, President Riva-Agüero convoked a
council of war, which resulted in the appointment of General Sucre as
commander-in-chief of the patriot army. Canterac entered Lima in June,
1823, with his splendid troops, but finding that Santa Cruz was on his
way to the interior he retired to Jauja. With the advent of Canterac’s
army into Lima, the republicans removed their headquarters to Callao,
and later, to Trujillo. The difficulties incident to the inauguration of
a new form of government occurred in the present case; a quarrel arose
between Congress and executive, the president resenting the action of
Congress in bestowing supreme authority on General Sucre, and the
president’s enemies seeking to undermine his authority. General Sucre,
who immediately set out with his army to overtake Santa Cruz, gave the
command of the capital to the Marquis de Torre-Tagle. The enemies of
President Riva-Agüero secured his downfall, and after being
treacherously seized and imprisoned, he was forced to retire from the
country. He was one of the most distinguished characters of the
revolution and his services deserved a better reward. Posterity is proud
to honor, as one of the heroes of his country, the Grand Marshal
Riva-Agüero, Marquis de Monte Alegre and Chevalier of the Order of
Charles III.

General Bolivar arrived in Lima on the 1st of September, 1823. He was
received with the greatest enthusiasm, and was immediately invested by
Congress with supreme authority, military and political. Later, his
power was amplified, General Necochea being at the same time made
political and military chief of the capital, to replace the Marquis de
Torre-Tagle who fell into disgrace, through his correspondence with
General Canterac. As soon as possible, Bolivar began plans for the
accomplishment of the great purpose that had brought him to Peru, and
two months after his arrival he left Lima to establish military
headquarters at Pativilca, two hundred miles north of the capital and
due west of Cerro de Pasco near which the royalist troops were
stationed, in the department of Junin. Preparations were at once begun
for a campaign against the enemy. The Liberating Army, which consisted
of six thousand Colombian and four thousand Peruvian troops, was
organized in three divisions,—two Colombian, under Generals Cordova and
Lara, and one Peruvian, under General La Mar, the Peruvian cavalry being
placed in charge of General Miller, that of Colombia under Colonel
Carbajal’s orders, and the Argentine cavalry under Colonel Bruiz, while
General Necochea commanded the united cavalry force, General Sucre, who
had returned from the interior, being appointed chief of staff of the
whole army.

The presence of the great Bolivar, whose victorious campaigns in
Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador had sealed the independence of those
countries on the battlefields of Boyacá, Carabobo, Bomboná, and
Pichincha, animated the now drooping spirits of the Peruvian patriots,
and filled all hearts with hope and confidence. In the month of July,
1824, the Liberating Army of the North began its march toward Cerro de
Pasco. The task of leading a large body of troops over the mountains was
tremendous, especially as the supply of provisions had to be kept up at
great cost, and the severity of the climate at such an altitude was a
serious drawback. Over a similar pathway, five hundred miles farther
north, the Conquerors had led their men three centuries earlier, on
their way to Cajamarca. But on what a different mission! They sought the
subjugation of a noble and gentle race, whom they hoped to rob and
enslave “by right of conquest”; these advancing hosts were seeking to
bring freedom and happiness to a suffering people. The victory of the
former brought only an ignominious destiny to the Conquerors; the
triumph of the latter is emblazoned in the high places of immortal
glory. Pizarro’s name is a synonym for cruelty and rapacity; the names
of San Martin and Bolivar thrill the soul, and stir its noblest
sentiments.

[Illustration: THE MUNICIPAL PALACE, LIMA.]

The final events in the history of South American independence took
place within a year after the beginning of Bolivar’s campaign on the
plateau of Junin. The story of Junin is soon told. While the royalists
remained inactive at Jauja, more than a hundred leagues to the south,
Bolivar reached the plateau, on the 5th of August, 1824, and reviewed
his troops, ten thousand strong, cheering them with those inspiring
addresses which great military captains of all ages have found so
effective. As soon as General Canterac learned of the approach of
Bolivar, he advanced with his army, consisting of eight thousand
infantry, thirteen hundred cavalry, and a proportion of field artillery,
as far as the lake of Junin, near the southern shore of which the famous
engagement took place. After a march of fifteen miles through a
mountainous district, Bolivar’s army reached an elevated point, from
which they obtained a sudden view of the royalist army, five miles away,
marching over the plains of Junin. The patriot cavalry, nine hundred
strong, having dashed forward, came up within a short distance of the
royalists; putting himself at the head of his cavalry, Canterac ordered
a charge which might have won the day, as the patriots, in their
enthusiasm, had placed themselves in an unfavorable position; but the
Spaniards were too sure of their victory and pushed in hot pursuit of
the retreating cavalry, thereby giving an opportunity for a Peruvian
battalion under Colonel Suarez, which had been detained in the marshes,
to advance on the rear of the royalist ranks and thus afford the
retreating forces a chance to rally; the result was a total and complete
victory over the Spaniards after a battle that lasted less than an hour,
during which not a shot was fired, the lance and sabre alone being used.
The royalists lost nineteen officers and three hundred and forty-five
soldiers of the line, besides eighty taken prisoners. The patriot losses
were three officers and forty-two soldiers of the line killed and one
hundred wounded.

The victory of Junin gave Bolivar command of Tarma, Jauja, Huancayo,
Huanta, and Huamanga. General Canterac retired to Cuzco where he was
joined by Valdes, and the viceroy himself then took command of the
united armies, with Canterac as his chief of staff. The Liberator placed
his troops in charge of General Sucre with instructions to go into
quarters in the Apurimac valley, east of Ayacucho, during the rainy
season. But the viceroy immediately began operations against the patriot
army, hoping to get a position in their rear and cut off communication
with Lima. While General Sucre fell back to Andahuaylas, La Serna led
his army across the Apurimac and around by Pampachira and Huamanga, and
there countermarched along the Cuzco highroad to meet the patriots. His
army numbered ten thousand men, with fourteen pieces of artillery, and
sixteen hundred cavalry, presenting a very formidable force. When
General Sucre found out that the viceroy was leading his army toward
Huamanga, he left Andahuaylas and marched westward, crossing the Pampas
River a few leagues southeast of Ayacucho, and reaching the village of
Quinua, at the western extremity of the plain, on the 6th of December.
The viceroy advanced and took his position on the heights of
Condorcunca, which rose abruptly along the eastern boundary of the
plain; General Sucre’s troops were encamped in front of the Spaniards,
about a mile distant and having Quinua in the rear. On the morning of
December 9, 1824, the armies were ready for battle. The patriot forces
were formed in close columns, General Cordova commanding the right,
General La Mar the left, and General Miller the centre, with General
Gamarra as first chief of staff. The troops did not number more than
five thousand, but every soldier was fighting for a cause dearer than
life itself, and every heart thrilled with patriotic fervor as General
Sucre, in an inspiring voice, recalled their former achievements and
urged them to fight for their honor and the salvation of their country,
exclaiming: “On the efforts of to-day depends the fate of South
America!” As the royalist army was seen descending Condorcunca, he
added, pointing to their glittering columns: “Another day of glory is
about to crown your admirable constancy.” When the enemy appeared on the
plain, General Sucre ordered the Cordova division and two regiments of
cavalry to advance to the charge.

The field of Ayacucho presented an animated scene as the signal to
attack was given by the gallant Cordova, who, dismounting and placing
himself in front of his division, waved his sword above his head with
the enthusiastic order “Forward, with the step of victors!” His
confident bearing had an immediate effect on the troops, and they moved
to the attack in splendid order, the charge, which was made in four
parallel columns with the cavalry in the intervals, proving fatal to the
enemy. The historical fight was won after a little more than an hour’s
struggle, during which the royalists were driven back with great
slaughter. At first, the viceroy’s troops fought with skill and courage,
but they were gradually driven back and obliged to abandon the field.
The viceroy was wounded and taken prisoner, which had a depressing
effect on his followers. General Valdes made an unexpected detour and
attacked the left flank of the patriot army with such success that the
fortunes of the day hung for a few moments in the balance; La Mar’s
forces were obliged to retreat, and a part of Lara’s division which went
to his assistance was also driven back; but at this critical juncture
General Miller, commanding the Junin Hussars, made a splendid charge,
forcing the enemy to retreat and giving the patriots time to recover
their position. An impetuous charge was then made on Valdes’s ranks,
which sent cavalry and infantry flying in all directions. The victory
was won; General Canterac and General Valdes, as well as thirteen other
generals, five hundred officers and three thousand rank and file, became
prisoners of war. Before sunset General Canterac sued for terms, and a
capitulation was agreed upon which does the highest credit to the
generous spirit of the victors. The losses to the royalists were
fourteen hundred killed and seven hundred wounded, while the patriots
had three hundred and seventy killed and six hundred and nine wounded.

Such was the victorious outcome of the battle of Ayacucho, which has
been pronounced the most brilliant ever fought in South America, on
account of the splendid discipline of the troops, the skill and daring
of the officers, the presence of the ablest chiefs and highest
representatives of both the opposing forces, and the undaunted bravery
of the entire army on both sides. It is said that the viceroy’s mistake
lay in making any attack at all, but that he was impelled to it by the
eagerness of his troops, tired of their long marches. After the victory,
Huamanga received the name of Ayacucho. By the terms of the capitulation
the Spanish officers were given their passports, and many of them set
out for Spain immediately. The victory put an end to Spanish dominion in
South America, the Viceroy La Serna recognizing, by his signature to the
capitulation, the absolute independence of Peru. The subsequent history
of the Republic is a record of the progress and development of a nation
which had to learn the lesson of self-government after having been for
centuries accustomed to give unquestioning allegiance to an absolute
monarch, under a system that gave all honor to military prestige and
social rank, and regarded as unworthy of consideration any human rights
that were based on liberty, equality or fraternity.

                               CHAPTER IX
                    PERU UNDER REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT


[Illustration: MONUMENT DOS DE MAYO.]

The Independence of Peru was the crowning glory of the Spanish-American
revolution. Here, in the heart and centre of colonial monarchism, where
the very existence of society seemed to be threatened in the event of a
change of government, and the vigilance of the authorities was so active
that a single word in favor of liberty, spoken in an unguarded moment,
was sufficient to place its author under the fatal ban of the Holy
Office, the patriotic spirit had, nevertheless, grown and developed,
awaiting only a fair chance to dominate an overpowering environment. The
Viceroy Pezuela realized the force of national sentiment when he
hesitated to send his troops against General San Martin at Huaura,
although the royalist army then at his command numbered eight thousand
men, and he had every advantage over the precarious position of the
patriots. The defection of the “Numancia” regiment, following on the
capture of the _Esmeralda_ and the victory of Cerro de Pasco, seemed to
overwhelm the Spanish authorities with a sense of insecurity, as if they
realized that these reverses signified a more powerful force at work to
destroy the government than was apparent in the small army of the
Liberator.

The fight in Peru was won in the secret councils of the patriotic party
before the opposing forces met on the battlefield. When the standard of
the Liberating Army was unfurled on the plain of Ayacucho, it mattered
little that the royalist strength doubled that of the patriots, and that
the viceroy himself appeared in the field, his silver helmet glistening
at the head of his troops; the spirit of the warrior prepared for
glorious victory or sublime sacrifice which animated every soldier of
the republican army was not apparent in the royalist ranks; the officers
in command of the king’s forces were discontented because they were
obliged to obey a foreign leader, General Canterac being a Frenchman of
haughty manners and exacting discipline; the Indians were all patriots
at heart and had been pressed into the royal service against their will:
a presentiment of defeat had spread through the viceroy’s camp the night
before the battle, in spite of the royalists’ superior numbers, and
there was none of the exaltation which carried their opponents into the
combat with the exuberant confidence expressed in the order: “Forward,
with the step of victory!”

The glad news of the final triumph of the patriotic cause was carried
rapidly to every part of the country, and the joy of the people found
expression in enthusiastic demonstrations of all kinds. In every city
and town, religious services were held to render thanks to God for the
success which had crowned the efforts of the nation to establish its
freedom. The Liberator Bolivar was proclaimed by Congress president of
the new republic for life, and the Colombian troops were voted a
magnificent reward for their services in behalf of the independence of
Peru. Henceforth the country that had been held most strictly under the
bondage of Spanish conditions and customs was to be governed by its own
people, in harmony with the principles for which its patriots had so
courageously contended, and according to laws formulated and decreed on
the responsibility of its own constituted authorities.

In the days of the viceroyalty the colonial offices of importance had
been filled chiefly by Spaniards, the natives of the colony thus having
had little opportunity to learn administrative methods. They were now to
undertake the organization of a system of government which was not only
unfamiliar to them, but which, considering the national temperament and
traditions, it would be impossible to establish without overcoming
tremendous obstacles.

As soon as the victory of Ayacucho was assured, General Sucre led his
army to Cuzco, and this ancient city was once more the scene of
celebrations in honor of a great conquest; though, while the former had
meant the destruction and slavery of the original inhabitants, this one
signified their emancipation and protection. It was fitting that the
capital of the Inca empire which had been subjugated by Spain three
hundred years before, should be the first city to receive the patriots
who had won its independence, and that the children of the new Peru
should link their destiny with the descendants of its oldest
civilization on this historic ground, both of them proud to claim the
title of Peruvians.

After a short stay in Cuzco, General Sucre proceeded to Alto Peru, where
he was chosen to preside over the first congress of the new republic,
named Bolivia in honor of the Liberator, who was also invited to become
its president for life. In acknowledgment of this distinction, General
Bolivar went to Chuquisaca, afterward called Sucre to compliment the
hero of Ayacucho, and took charge of the government, drawing up the
famous constitution that received his name, and which he afterward
tried, unsuccessfully, to impose on Peru. He abdicated the presidency in
favor of General Sucre within a year and returned to Lima, where a
council of government had ruled during his absence. The Liberator did
not remain long in Peru, however, retiring from the country permanently
on the 3d of September, 1827, to go to Colombia. General Andrés Santa
Cruz became the president of the council of government after Bolivar’s
abdication. He convoked Congress to meet for the election of the
president of the republic and to frame the national constitution. The
question of establishing a satisfactory government code occupied the
attention of successive administrations for twenty-five years, during
which eight constitutions, based on republican ideas of government, were
promulgated, the last, decreed in 1860, being still in force.

General La Mar succeeded Bolivar in the presidency; but as his native
province, Quito, had been separated from Peru by the Liberator, and
included in the new republic of Colombia, his election was declared null
and void by a clause of the constitution, which provided that the
president should be a Peruvian by birth. He hoped, however, to annex his
native territory to Peru and thus legalize his position; and the
opportunity to make the attempt came as a result of his interference in
the affairs of Bolivia, which caused the abdication of General Sucre and
the election of General Andrés Santa Cruz as president of that country.
Bolivar resented the proceeding and declared war on Peru, to which La
Mar responded by marching into Guayaquil with an army of four thousand
men and taking possession of the city. He was forced to retreat before
the Colombian army and withdrew to Piura, where he received news of his
deposition from the presidency and of the election of General Gamarra, a
native of Cuzco, who was inaugurated on August 31, 1829.

The military spirit was too strong, and the principles of representative
government were too little understood in the beginning of the new life
of Peru to admit of a strict conformity to the republican constitution;
and it is not surprising that the descendants of a race of soldiers,
with all the traditions implanted by an absolute monarchy, should err at
first in their interpretation of political freedom. It was to be
expected that the heroes of the Independence would be chosen to fill the
highest places of honor in the new government, although the very nature
and disposition of a successful military leader often disqualify him for
the duties of civil administration. The earlier presidents were all men
who had fought for the Independence, and with the exception of La Fuente
(vice-president in La Mar’s cabinet and president in the interim),
Orbegoso, and Vidal, they had been identified with the victory of
Ayacucho.

In the frequent changes of government that occurred during the first ten
years of the republic, some of the administrations were of short
duration and of little historical importance. President Gamarra was
despotic and arbitrary, and aroused the opposition of the more liberal
members of Congress, who, led by the deputy from Tacna, Don Francisco de
Paula Gonzalez Vigil, openly protested on the floor of the House against
the unconstitutional conduct of the chief executive. It was the
beginning of a persistent struggle to overcome militarism and to
establish the government of Peru on a basis more consistent with the
ideals of a modern republic. President Gamarra was in turn succeeded, in
1833, by President Orbegoso, whose administration was disturbed by
continuous revolts in consequence of the irregularity of his election,
and the jealousy of rival candidates. On the 23rd of January, 1835,
General Salaverry, commander of the garrison of Callao, who had been
promoted to the rank of brigadier-general for his services in support of
President Orbegoso during previous revolts, suddenly declared himself
against the government, which he said was dishonored by illegal arrests
and acts of injustice. He was a high-minded, though impetuous, young
officer, and he won many followers, being able to secure command of the
government, which he directed with good purpose and ability; his
authority was recognized for several months in all the republic except
Arequipa, where Orbegoso had his stronghold. The latter sought the
assistance of President Santa Cruz of Bolivia, and the overthrow of
Salaverry was accomplished after a series of engagements in which the
Bolivian army was repeatedly checked; the battle of Socabaya, which took
place on February 7, 1836, brought the struggle to an end, Salaverry
being taken prisoner and condemned to be shot. This sentence was carried
into effect in the central plaza of Arequipa ten days later. General
Santa Cruz then proclaimed the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, which was
divided into three states, northern and southern Peru and Bolivia;
Orbegoso was made president of northern Peru and General Herrera of
southern Peru, while General Santa Cruz became supreme director of the
confederation with the powers of a dictator.

[Illustration: DON MANUEL PARDO. THE FIRST CIVIL PRESIDENT OF PERU.]

The Peru-Bolivian Confederation, inaugurated on the 1st of May, 1837,
was not only unpopular in Peru and Bolivia, but it led to war with
Chile. The Chilean invasion has been called the Nemesis of Salaverry, as
the Chilean ships were full of exiled Peruvians, glad to have this
opportunity to fight against Santa Cruz, the author of Salaverry’s
defeat and death. Orbegoso deserted Santa Cruz and retired to Guayaquil.
The Chilean forces were commanded by General Bulnes, who defeated the
army of Santa Cruz in the battle of Yungay, in 1839, the “Supreme
Protector” making his escape to Guayaquil, whence he sailed to France.
The confederation was dissolved by General Santa Cruz prior to his
leaving the country, and General Gamarra was proclaimed president of the
republic for a second time. His ambition led him to invade Bolivia,
where he was defeated and killed, in the battle of Ingavi in 1841.
During his absence from Peru, Colonel Manuel Ignacio Vivanco seized the
reins of government, declaring Gamarra’s election illegal. He was
deposed by General Castilla, Gamarra’s commander-in-chief.

On the death of President Gamarra, Don Manuel Menendez assumed supreme
power, but his election was disputed by La Fuente and Vivanco, who
supported General Vidal for the presidency, while, in the meantime,
General Torrico took more violent measures and deposed Menendez,
declaring himself president. The greatest confusion followed, Vidal
taking the field against Torrico, who was defeated. General Vidal,
however, was more desirous of restoring order and peace than covetous of
political honors, and in order to avoid further dissension, he resigned
in favor of President Menendez; though a few days later his action was
nullified by that of a new faction that declared in favor of General
Vivanco, who assumed the government on the 8th of April, 1844. The
unsettled political condition was a natural consequence of President
Gamarra’s death in Bolivia, and it continued until a leader appeared who
possessed the resolution and strength necessary to establish order and
authority.

General Ramón Castilla, who was elected president of Peru in 1845,
accomplished a great deal in promoting the welfare of his country.
Possessing extraordinary administrative ability, he reorganized the
various branches of public service, suppressed the taxation of the
Indians, definitely abolished slavery, advanced education and undertook
the construction of public works of great importance. During this
administration, the first railways in Peru were built, between Lima and
Callao (in 1848), also between Lima and Chorillos, and the first
telegraphic service was established. The finances of the government were
regulated by subjecting the national expenditures to an estimate
sanctioned by Congress. Municipal improvements were encouraged
throughout the republic, and the prefects of the various departments
vied with one another in the construction of good roads, commodious
public buildings and other progressive enterprises. Steam navigation,
which had been initiated between Valparaiso and Callao in 1840, was
extended to Panamá, the service being increased. The navy was
reorganized and five new war vessels, operated by steam, were added to
the squadron. The wealth of the republic increased in consequence of a
great demand for the guano of the Chincha Islands, which became a source
of immense revenue, and the government was thus enabled to arrange for
the payment of the interest on the national debt:—a loan of one million
two hundred thousand pounds sterling had been made in London in 1822,
and another of six hundred thousand pounds in 1825, both at six per
cent, which with the accumulated interest made a debt of nearly four
million pounds. Negotiations were concluded by which the interest on
this sum could be paid regularly.

[Illustration: THE MORRO OF ARICA.]

After six years of peaceful government President Castilla was succeeded
by President Echenique, whose administration lasted from 1851 to 1855,
when he was deposed and President Castilla was reëlected. During his
second term, this indefatigable statesman continued to devote his
efforts to the improvement of the public service. Especial attention was
given to the construction and discipline of the prisons. The foundations
of the present penitentiary of Lima were laid in accordance with plans
prepared and submitted by Dr. Mariano Paz Soldan, who had the work in
charge. When, in 1862, the reins of government were passed to his
successor, Grand Marshal Don Miguel San Román, President Castilla
retired from office with everything to his credit that a patriot who has
rendered good service to his country may claim. Three years later he
became president of the Senate, at seventy years of age. By the terms of
the constitution of 1860, the presidential period, which formerly lasted
for six years, was reduced to four, the president not being permitted
henceforth to succeed himself by reëlection for a second term. President
San Román, son of the martyred patriot of Umachiri, lived only a few
months after his election, and was succeeded by Vice-President Pezet,
during whose administration a conflict arose with Spain, with dire
consequences to the prestige of the president. The Chincha Islands were
seized by a Spanish fleet on the pretext of guaranteeing certain unjust
claims, and President Pezet, who found himself unable to offer
resistance, was obliged to make a settlement with Spain which was so
unfair to Peru that it called forth vigorous protest and led to a
revolution. The second vice-president, General Pedro Diez Canseco and
Colonel Mariano Ignacio Prado were the leaders of the movement against
President Pezet, who, rather than plunge his country into civil war,
resigned office, Colonel Prado being proclaimed dictator in November,
1865.

One of the first acts of Dictator Prado was to form an alliance with
Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile to combat the aggressive designs of Spain.
After an engagement between the allies and the Spaniards at Abtao, in
the Chiloe archipelago, the latter proceeded to Valparaiso, which they
bombarded, thence going on to Callao, where after a five hours’ fight
they were defeated and obliged to withdraw, never to return. Chile
expressed the greatest admiration for the bravery and patriotism shown
by the Peruvians, the Chilean minister in Lima writing to his government
in praise of “the noble and valiant nation.” The city of Santiago
presented President Prado with a sword, in token of appreciation. Though
the administration of Dictator Prado was liberal and his authority mild,
the spirit of the nation was now opposed to an unconstitutional
government, and in 1868 he abdicated in favor of General Canseco, who
immediately convoked Congress to elect a new president. The choice fell
on Colonel José Balta. His administration is noted for the extensive
improvements made in public works during that period, from 1868 to 1872.

The influence of militarism, which had been so powerful during the first
days of the republic, gradually declined, as republican principles
became better established and a younger generation grew up more zealous
for the moral and material development of the country than for glorious
records of the battlefield. General Pezet was the last of the heroes of
Ayacucho who occupied the presidency. Colonel Balta was only eight years
old when the victory of Ayacucho was won, and thus, born a child of the
republic, he grew to manhood under conditions which enabled him to
appreciate the needs as well as the accomplishments of the nation. He
saw that, in order to realize the progress for which the people were so
earnestly struggling, greater facilities of communication were
indispensable, and he devoted his attention especially to the
construction of important railways, their cost being defrayed with the
product of the national loans of the years 1869, 1870, and 1872. These
loans increased the foreign debt of Peru to thirty-two million nine
hundred and fifty-four thousand pounds sterling, and the sales of guano
were pledged as security for its payment. During this administration,
the region of the Amazon, which had been opened up to traffic by General
Castilla, was put in closer communication with the capital, explorations
being made on the tributaries—Pachitea, Perené, and others. The city of
Lima was beautified, a new iron bridge was built across the Rimac River,
and a great industrial fair was inaugurated, the handsome Exposition
Palace being built for the purpose. When his presidential term expired,
in 1872, Don Manuel Pardo, who had founded the civil party in opposition
to militarism, was elected his successor. A few days before President
Balta was to retire from office, his Minister of War, Colonel Tomás
Gutierrez, in conspiracy with officers of the army, effected a _coup
d’ètat_, overpowering the president, who was carried off and imprisoned,
and, later, assassinated. Gutierrez caused himself to be proclaimed by
his officers Supreme Ruler of Peru; he had already given secret orders
for the capture of Don Manuel Pardo,—whom he was determined to get out
of the way in order to establish his authority more securely,—but the
president-elect was informed of the imminent danger which threatened him
and he succeeded in making his escape on board a man-of-war which lay in
the harbor. But the _coup d’état_ found no sympathy with any political
party, and had no significance beyond the ineffectual attempt of a few
soldiers of inflamed ambition and little patriotism to impose their will
on a law-abiding people; the citizens of Lima and Callao rose _en masse_
against the treacherous soldiers and overthrew them, putting to death
Tomás Gutierrez and two of his three brothers implicated in the deed.
The surviving brother deeply repented his share in the revolt, and spent
the remainder of his life in an honest and brave attempt to expiate his
crime.

[Illustration: DON MANUEL CANDAMO—ELECTED PRESIDENT OF PERU 1903, DIED
1904.]

President Manuel Pardo was inaugurated on the 2d of August, 1872. Born
in Lima in 1834, of a family distinguished for generations as statesmen
and men of letters, he had early imbibed the sentiments of patriotism.
His education began in the college of San Carlos, Lima, and was
completed in Barcelona and Paris, where he developed an especial
interest in the study of political science and finance. When still in
his early twenties he began his public career as one of the founders of
_La Revista de Lima_, a periodical of importance; and, in 1858, he
received the appointment of _Oficial Mayor_ in the Ministry of Finance.
In 1864, the first bank in Lima was founded by him, and, during the
administration of the Dictator Prado, he was promoted to the post of
Minister of Finance. As mayor of Lima and as director of its benevolent
societies, his official services were of such importance that the
citizens presented him with a gold medal in token of their gratitude.
This occurred during a period when the capital was visited by an
epidemic.

Possessing unusual gifts and wide experience, President Pardo was well
equipped to fulfil the highest duties of the state. He devoted himself
with particular energy and purpose to the intellectual development of
his country, and introduced radical reforms in various branches of the
public service. In no period of the republic was more rapid progress
shown in the culture of the people than during this administration, when
the encouragement of education stimulated a love of knowledge among all
classes. A Faculty of Political and Administrative Science was created,
also a School of Engineers and a School of Science and Arts; the
military and naval schools were reorganized, and the School for
Midshipmen of the Navy as well as the School for Corporals and Sergeants
of the Army was established. The present system of modern instruction
conforms to the code promulgated by President Pardo. His administrative
ability was seen in every department of the government. He organized the
national guard and the police service; established departmental,
provincial, and district councils, to overcome municipal centralization;
coöperated with the judiciary in maintaining the authority of their
decisions; ensured the stability of the financial system and reformed
the mining code.

Unfortunately, the administration of President Manuel Pardo succeeded a
period of material expansion so costly that the responsibilities
resulting therefrom were of extraordinary weight and difficulty, and
could be met only by heroic sacrifices. The public debt called for an
immense sum to pay the interest, and caused a financial and economic
crisis, which made it impossible to redeem the bank notes, and
necessitated the issuance of government notes. In order to improve the
economic situation, President Pardo, realizing that Peru contained the
world’s chief nitrate and guano deposits, conceived the plan of
establishing a nitrate monopoly. He hoped by controlling the nitrate
output to destroy the competition which nitrate had waged against guano,
the country’s principal source of revenue, and the chief means of paying
its public debt. By this and other patriotic measures, a reform in
existing conditions was to be effected which would relieve the financial
strain and restore the prosperity of the country. But the intensity of
the commercial crisis and the unsettled state of politics that always
accompanies panic conditions, made it impossible for the great statesman
to realize his hopes, and his administration was a continued struggle
through one of the most trying financial periods of the republic.
President Manuel Pardo, the founder of the Civil party, was the first
executive to dominate the tendency which had hitherto prevailed in
Peruvian politics of keeping the public offices in the hands of a
privileged class. He was impartial in his recognition of superior worth
wherever he found it.

The dictator, Don Mariano Prado, was elected constitutional president to
succeed President Pardo in 1876, the latter being called to the Senate,
of which he became president the following year. On the 16th of
November, 1878, while passing through the ante-room to the Senate
Chamber, the illustrious statesman met his death at the hand of an
assassin. An ignorant sergeant committed the deed which robbed Peru of
one of her noblest and devoted patriots, and plunged the whole nation
into grief. By what strange fatality the defender of the masses and
their most sincere protector should have been murdered by one of their
number is no more to be explained than that Lincoln, Garfield, and
McKinley should have been similarly sacrificed while laboring in behalf
of the sacred principles of human liberty.

In the year 1879 the war of the Pacific was inaugurated by Chile, whose
government claimed that its interests were threatened in consequence of
a treaty of alliance made six years earlier between Peru and Bolivia,
which Chile denominated a secret compact. The treaty was known to the
Chilean Minister in Bolivia in 1874, however, and was officially
announced to Argentina in 1876. According to some authorities, Chile
sought a pretext for war, hoping to gain possession of the nitrate beds
of Tarapacá. In any case, its government was well prepared for war,
having just reorganized its navy and purchased the new ironclads
_Almirante Cochrane_ and _Blanco Encalada_, which were superior to the
Peruvian ironclads _Huascar_ and _Independencia_, purchased ten years
earlier. The first attack was made on Bolivia, but that country was in
no condition to resist a powerful enemy, and the war soon became a trial
of strength between Chile and Peru. The first naval engagement occurred
off the coast of Iquique, Rear-Admiral Miguel Grau commanding the
_Huascar_, and Captain Moore the _Independencia_, against the Chilean
corvette _Esmeralda_, commanded by Captain Arthur Prat, and the gunboat
_Covadonga_, commanded by Captain Condell. The _Esmeralda_ was sunk by
the guns of the _Huascar_ and Captain Prat lost his life in the
engagement, though fighting with great heroism. A letter from Admiral
(then Captain) Grau of the _Huascar_ to the widow of the Chilean hero,
reveals the noble character and gentle heart of the victorious
commander, who was soon to meet his own death fighting against greater
odds. “Captain Prat died,” he wrote, “a victim to his excessive
intrepidity in the defence and for the glory of the flag of his country.
I sincerely deplore this mournful event, and in expressing my sympathy,
I take the opportunity of forwarding the precious relics that he carried
on his person when he fell, believing that they may afford some slight
consolation in the midst of your great sorrow.” Such thoughtful
tenderness inspires the greatest admiration for this brave man. Meantime
the _Independencia_ in pursuit of the _Covadonga_, and drawing much more
water than the adversary, suddenly ran on the rocks and became a total
wreck, this fatal accident proving a deathblow to Peru, as the strength
of the Chilean fleet was now overwhelming. The brilliant exploits of
Admiral Grau kept the enemy at bay for four months, during which he
protected the Peruvian coast by a series of rapid and skilful manœuvres.
The discontent in Chile over the inactivity of the fleet became so great
that a new War Minister was appointed, whose first act was to order the
two ironclads back to Valparaiso to be overhauled, as they were no match
in speed for the _Huascar_. The Chilean navy was practically
reorganized, merchant ships were engaged to transport troops, and a few
were purchased to be used as men-of-war. The naval fight was really a
single-handed encounter between the _Huascar_ and the two Chilean
ironclads. Admiral Grau’s heroism was sublime. The English historian,
Clements R. Markham, who has written a detailed description of this war,
says that “the Chilean squadron consisting of two ironclads and several
other vessels, all carefully and thoroughly refitted, was despatched
from Valparaiso for the purpose of forcing the _Huascar_ to fight
single-handed against hopeless odds.” Meantime gallant Grau was along
the coast, doing his utmost to hinder the preparations of the Chileans
for a military invasion of Peru. On the morning of the 8th of October,
1879, as the _Huascar_, followed by the gunboat _Union_, was slowly
steaming northward from Antofagasta, the three Chilean warships, the
_Blanco Encalada_, _Covadonga_, and _Matias Cousiño_ appeared in sight
to the northeast near Point Angamos; the _Huascar_ turned to the
northwest and put on all speed to escape the enemy, when suddenly the
_Almirante Cochrane_, _O’Higgins_, and _Loa_ came into view, heading
from the very direction in which the _Huascar_ was steering. Undismayed
by the critical situation, Admiral Grau ordered Captain Garcia y Garcia,
the commander of the _Union_ to put on full speed and get out of danger,
as in case of the loss of the _Huascar_ the _Union_ would be the only
serviceable vessel left to Peru. In the fight which followed, a shell
from the _Cochrane_ struck the pilot tower of the _Huascar_, in which
were Admiral Grau and one of his lieutenants, destroying the tower and
killing its occupants, who were blown to pieces. The brave hero and his
ship met their doom by the same blow, as, up to that moment, the
_Huascar_ had held its own. A few minutes later, the _Blanco Encalada_
fired on the doomed _Huascar_, its shell killing Captain Elias Aguirre,
who had taken the admiral’s place. No sooner had he fallen than his
successor, Captain Manuel Carbajal, met the same fate, to be followed by
Lieutenant Rodriguez, whose place was immediately taken by Lieutenant
Enrique Palacios, until a fragment of shell struck him down and the
command devolved on Lieutenant Garezon. When the terrible combat ended,
it was found that one-third of the one hundred and ninety-three officers
and men on the _Huascar_ had been killed or wounded.

[Illustration: GENERAL ANDRÉS CÁCERES, PRESIDENT OF PERU, 1886–1890 AND
1894–1895.]

In the hecatomb of Angamos perished Peru’s last hope of keeping the
enemy from an attack on the coast, which extended fourteen hundred miles
in length and presented peculiar difficulties of defence, because of the
desert regions that occur at intervals. The movement of troops was
practically impossible in case of a blockade of the ports, and the
uncertainty of the chosen point of attack made it necessary to prepare
for defence everywhere. In November 1879 the invading Chilean army,
consisting of ten thousand men, and supported by the Chilean fleet,
began a series of attacks on land which, with the exception of the
battle of Tarapacá and a few minor engagements, resulted in victory for
the invading troops. The only advantage Peru could claim lay in the
skill of her generals and other commanding officers who performed
miracles in manœuvring the small forces at their disposal. General
Buendia, commander-in-chief of the Peruvian army, was fortunate in the
officers who surrounded him. His chief staff officer, Colonel Suarez,
who led the troops in the victory of Tarapacá, and Colonel (now General)
Andrés Cáceres, who received the felicitations of his chief on the field
of battle on that memorable occasion, showed themselves worthy
descendants of a race of warriors; Colonel Bolognesi, Colonel Zubiaga,
Colonel Pardo de Figueroa, Colonel Rios, all of whom lost their lives in
the service of their country, were soldiers whose military genius, no
less than their heroism, reflected glory on their country. The name of
Bolognesi is especially revered in Peru, in memory of the heroic fight
which this indomitable hero made on the Morro de Arica, June 5, 1880.
The war had gone against the allies, the command of the sea giving the
Chileans a tremendous advantage; though, in spite of their watchfulness,
the _Union_ and small transports succeeded in running the blockades and
getting troops, arms, and clothing to the Peruvian army at various
points. The assault and capture of Arica was to bring the struggle close
to its final scene—the last formal resistance on the part of Peru being
made at Huamachuco under the command of General Cáceres—and this
thrilling event proved a fitting climax to one of the saddest dramas in
the history of republican America. Colonel Francisco Bolognesi was given
command of the defence of Arica. With him were Captain Moore, Alfonso
Ugarte, Colonel Inclan, Arias, Varela, and the Cornejo brothers, all
prepared to die with their leader rather than surrender. The heavy
bombardment from the _Cochrane_, _Magallanes_, _Covadonga_, and _Loa_
was answered by the monitor _Manco Ccapac_ and the shore batteries, the
guns on the Morro doing effective service; but the odds were more than
two to one of disciplined troops against volunteers and the result was
inevitable. Bolognesi, Moore, and Alfonso Ugarte stood together at the
guns as the fort was taken, and met the death of heroes. The story of
Arica and of the events which followed chills one with horror at the
thought that such things could be; and the nation to whom victory was
thus brought must sincerely regret that it was won at such dreadful
cost. Peruvian industries and commerce were paralyzed, as if the whole
land had been scourged by a plague; and the beautiful City of the Kings,
with its population of one hundred thousand, as well as the suburbs,
Chorillos and Miraflores, presented a spectacle of general desolation.

The War of the Pacific lasted four years and a half, and closed with the
Treaty of Ancón, which was signed in Lima on the 23d of October, 1883,
by General Manuel Iglesias, the commander of the Peruvian army in the
north, who believed there was no other way to obtain peace than by
submission. In accordance with this treaty, the province of Tarapacá,
with its valuable nitrate fields, was given up to Chile unconditionally
and for all time; and the provinces of Tacna and Arica were ceded for a
period of ten years, subject, at the expiration of that time, to a
plebiscite, which would definitely establish their nationality; it being
stipulated that the country in whose favor it should result, should pay
to the other the sum of ten million pesos. This plebiscite has not yet
been held. After the signing of this treaty, General Iglesias assumed
command of the government, the Assembly convoked by him ratifying his
appointment as president of Peru and approving the Treaty of Ancón. But
a great part of the nation refused to recognize his authority and could
not be induced to lay down their arms; General Cáceres, who with General
Canevaro and others had sustained the honor of their country through
four years of incessant struggle against heavy odds, continued the
bitter fight to the last.

On the 2d of December, 1885, General Cáceres occupied Lima and was
installed as constitutional president of the republic on August 10,
1886, seven years after the declaration of war by Chile. He was the
unanimous choice of the nation and was elected amid the acclamations of
the people, without regard to political parties, his election signifying
the final restoration of peace. President Cáceres devoted his chief
attention to reorganizing the various departments of the administration.
The consolidation of the public debt was effected, the foreign debt
contracted by the loans of 1869, 1870, and 1872 being cancelled by a
contract with the corporation which represented the bondholders. By this
contract, Peru ceded, in payment of its debt, the usufruct, for
sixty-six years, of all the state railways and the guano in Peru, not,
however, in excess of three million tons, and furthermore obligated
itself to pay eighty thousand pounds a year for thirty-three years in
consideration of the construction of one hundred and sixty kilometres of
railway in addition to the mileage already built.

When General Cáceres retired from the presidency in 1890 he was
succeeded by Colonel Remigio Morales Bermudez, who died just before the
expiration of his term in 1894. The second vice-president, General
Borgoño, assumed the presidency, disregarding the right of the first
vice-president, Dr. Alejandrino del Solar. The disturbances threatened
by this irregular proceeding culminated when General Cáceres assumed
command of the government for the second time, though his attitude
brought about the coalition of the Civil and Constitutional parties,
formerly antagonistic but henceforth proving a powerful combination for
political peace and progress. General Cáceres resigned from the
presidency in March, 1895, and a governmental committee took charge of
the administration, presided over by Don Manuel Candamo, its first act
being to convoke Congress for a general election.

[Illustration: SCENE ON BOARD A PERUVIAN WARSHIP.]

General Don Andrés Avelino Cáceres stands among the foremost leaders of
Peruvian politics, combining, with extraordinary success, the gifts of a
soldier and a statesman, fearless and unyielding on the battlefield,
clear-headed and resolute in the cabinet. Born in Ayacucho on the 11th
of November, 1838, the hero of many combats has passed his three score
and ten years with the same disdain of fatigue in his march with Time
that he used to display when outgeneralling the enemy of his country.
When only sixteen years of age he solicited and received the appointment
of sub-lieutenant in the Ayacucho battalion. He fought with credit under
General Castilla, who afterward sent the handsome young soldier to Paris
as military attaché to the Peruvian Legation. During the administration
of the dictator Prado he was prefect of Cuzco, and when the war of the
Pacific began, he was among the first to march to Tarapacá with his
famous battalion, “Zepita,” which he commanded as Lieutenant Colonel;
his bravery at Tarapacá, Tacna, Chorillos, Miraflores, Pucará, and
Huamachuco, made his name renowned in war, as his efforts to establish
reform and progress in the government, which he twice directed as chief
executive, have brought him fame in the victories of peace.

The result of the elections of 1895 was the choice of Don Nicolás de
Pierola, a well-known statesman, whose government was one of order and
improvement in financial and industrial affairs. During his
administration the gold standard was adopted in Peru, the monetary unit
being the Peruvian pound, equal in weight and fineness to the English
pound sterling. This reform has greatly stimulated the investment of
foreign capital in Peru, the stability of exchange being an important
factor in attracting all kinds of enterprises. Among other noted
reforms, President Pierola secured the reorganization of the army,
obtaining from the French government the appointment of a military
mission to direct this work; a military school, under the direction of
French officers, was established, which has proved eminently
satisfactory. To President Pierola is also due the inauguration of the
national general postoffice, and projects for the construction of a
state prison, an insane asylum, and other edifices. His government was
marked by peace and order, and the country made rapid progress in
recuperating from the effects of the war of the Pacific. President
Pierola was succeeded by President Eduardo Lopez de Romaña, who
continued the work of peaceful development, retiring from office at the
end of his term to give place to President Manuel Candamo, who was
elected in 1903.

President Candamo was a statesman of progressive ideas and lofty
principles, and a leader of the Civil party, founded by Don Manuel
Pardo; his programme of government included many important measures for
the national well-being. A law was passed devoting the product of the
tobacco tax to the construction of new railways, and taxes were decreed
which doubled the fiscal revenue of the state. Every effort was made to
turn the people away from a bitter contemplation of the past, with its
terrible experiences, and to direct them toward a brighter future. The
remembrance of suffering and loss, under peculiarly unfortunate
circumstances, was resolutely stifled, to give place to the nobler
sentiments of aspiration and hope, under the guiding genius of a leader
who believed in looking forward, not backward; in overcoming hard
conditions, not in bewailing them. And the people were ready to follow
the wise direction of a chief executive who stimulated them to make
their best endeavors and who encouraged education, industrial
development, and commercial activity by every possible means. The
administration of President Candamo marked the inauguration of a new era
for Peru. The strife that had followed the period of war was buried away
never to be resurrected. The sentiment of the nation was shown to be in
accord with all that contributed to the peaceful progress of the
country. The principles of industry and prudence which had been so
earnestly upheld by his illustrious political teacher, Don Manuel Pardo,
were sustained and made more popular than they had ever been, by the
example of the new leader, who was the second president elected by the
Civil party. But his patriotic efforts were cut short by his death only
seven months after being elected to office, and the nation was called to
mourn the loss of one of its most illustrious sons. The demonstration of
grief with which the sad news of President Candamo’s death was greeted
in every town and hamlet of the republic afforded a touching evidence of
the esteem and affection he had won from all classes, the rich and the
poor, the proud and the humble, by his high principle and sterling
patriotism. The funeral ceremonies were attended with every honor that a
sorrowing nation could bestow in recognition of the dignity and glory
with which their lamented president had served his country. On the death
of President Candamo, the second vice-president, Señor Serapio Calderon,
succeeded to the office of chief executive. He governed with prudence
and success during the months that intervened between the death of
President Candamo and the inauguration of his successor, a period that
was marked by the unsettled conditions which are usual during the year
of the presidential election in all republican countries. By his
authority a general election was called which resulted in the choice of
Dr. José Pardo as president of the republic. The proclamation of his
election was attended by demonstrations of the national enthusiasm in a
series of banquets and speeches in all the cities of the republic, which
afforded opportunity for the expression of the spontaneous and sincere
admiration of his devoted supporters. His youthful appearance and
distinguished presence added to the interest which a recognition of his
well-proved ability and energy gained from the applauding multitude, and
the _vivas_ carried a note of affection as well as esteem as they were
repeated in every street and alley of the capital. On the 24th of
September, 1904, he was inaugurated by the sovereign will of the nation,
in accordance with the principles of the Civil party, founded by his
illustrious father. The record of his administration affords ample proof
of the good judgment of the people who elected him their chief
executive.

                               CHAPTER X
               THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT JOSÉ PARDO


[Illustration: POST OFFICE, LIMA.]

The inauguration of Dr. José Pardo took place amid the enthusiastic
demonstrations of a people who recognized in their chosen leader a
statesman of upright character and worthy principles, well equipped to
maintain the authority of a just, liberal, and progressive government.
There was more than the jubilant celebration of a victorious party in
the festivities of that day, the nation exhibiting an affectionate pride
in the accession of their young president, who followed in the path
opened up by his illustrious father and illuminated by President
Candamo, and who thus represented the highest hopes of civil government.

Although only forty years of age at the time of his election, President
Pardo was an experienced statesman and diplomatist, having been Minister
of Foreign Affairs and President of the Council of Ministers during the
administration of President Candamo, as well as diplomatic
representative of the government on a special mission to the Court of
Spain in a previous administration. His education, which began in the
Lima Institute, a college founded by President Manuel Pardo, was
directed in accordance with the liberal ideas that governed his father’s
principles, and from the beginning it became evident that the student
would develop into the statesman. When he was graduated from the
University of San Marcos at the age of twenty-five, he held the degrees
of Doctor of Jurisprudence and Doctor of Political and Social Science.
During President Candamo’s term, Dr. Pardo successfully advocated the
settlement by arbitration of difficult questions between his country and
Bolivia, Ecuador, and Brazil; and, as president of the ministerial
council, he was the principal leader in framing important laws for the
building of railroads and for fiscal reform which were afterward
sanctioned by Congress.

When President Pardo assumed office, he proceeded, with energy and
decision, though without any ostentatious display of reform, to carry
into effect the policy which he had adopted, and which was declared in
his inaugural message. The keynote of his administration is industrial
and educational progress, and at no time in the history of Peru have its
public institutions and private enterprises been in a more advanced and
promising condition. Toleration in religion, justice in legislation, and
an earnest endeavor to promote the well-being of the country, morally
and materially, have been exemplified in the attitude of President
Pardo’s government throughout the four years that he has guided the
destinies of the nation. In foreign relations, Peru has attained a more
honored position than ever before. The nation was represented with
distinction in the Pan-American Conference at Rio de Janeiro in 1906,
and at the International Conference of the Hague in 1907. In home
government, in military matters, in the departments of justice and
public instruction, in finance, and in the development of public works
of enormous benefit to the country, the results of a wise and careful
direction of executive authority are to be seen. Education has been
reformed and established on a uniform and democratic basis, the annual
appropriation of funds for this purpose having been increased under the
present government to three times the amount formerly set aside for its
maintenance; it now amounts to nearly one-tenth of the budget. The
postal service has received especial attention, and improvements have
been made which render it one of the most efficient branches of public
administration. The reconstruction of the national navy has been
effected during the present term, the new cruisers, _Grau_ and
_Bolognesi_, which arrived in 1907 from the European shipyards, being
handsome modern battleships.

Industrial progress has been fostered and encouraged by the extension of
railways, and new lines are under construction in every part of the
republic. Commerce has increased every year and the fiscal receipts have
nearly doubled within the past four years. Foreign capitalists are
constantly making new investments in the country, the statistics showing
that twenty-nine mining and agricultural enterprises were established in
Peru in 1907, of which a great many were of foreign ownership. The
sources of national wealth have increased, partly owing to the discovery
of valuable mines of coal and petroleum and to the revival of Peru’s
guano industry, which promises to be richer in production than ever
before. The interests of agriculture have been promoted by a careful
study of its needs in the various regions; hydrographic experts have
been employed to solve the problem of irrigation in the dry sections of
the coast and artesian wells have been sunk at various points in the
northern district. The importation of thoroughbred stock, the employment
of foreign specialists in the various branches of husbandry to give
lectures on the subject, and the free and liberal distribution of
pamphlets, reports, and maps throughout the farming communities have
been among the activities of the government in behalf of agricultural
reform.

Public health receives greater consideration and attention than
formerly, Congress having voted large sums for the purpose of carrying
out sanitary works in the centres of population throughout the republic,
especially in the ports. Commissions, composed of medical men and
engineers, have undertaken the improvement of sanitary and hygienic
conditions, and this important reform is now far advanced, many cities
already enjoying its benefits.

[Illustration: PATIO OF THE POST OFFICE, LIMA.]

President Pardo has been ably assisted in his administration by the
members of his cabinet, who have carried out the policy of their chief
with unfailing judgment. When elected, he selected the following
well-known statesmen to form his ministerial council: Dr. Javier Prado y
Ugarteche, Foreign Affairs; Dr. Augusto Leguia, Finance; Dr. Eulogio
Romero, Government and Home Affairs; General Muñiz, War and Marine; Dr.
Jorge Polar, Justice, Public Instruction and Worship; Dr. José Balta,
Public Works. The Minister of Public Works is also Minister of
_Fomento_, having in charge the patronage, or promotion, of public
enterprises. Under the direction of this cabinet the affairs of the
administration were conducted with eminent success, and when it was
succeeded by the present executive council, the progressive policy that
had been so well interpreted was continued, and still reigns. The
members of the cabinet at present are: Dr. Solón Polo, Foreign Affairs;
Dr. Carlos Washburn, Justice, Public Instruction and Worship; Dr. German
Schreiber, Finance; Dr. German Arenas, Government and Home Affairs;
General Juan N. Eléspuru, War and Marine; Dr. Delfin Vidalón, Fomento
and Public Works.

Dr. Solón Polo, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, enjoys the distinction
of being one of the best informed statesmen of Peru regarding diplomatic
questions between his country and foreign powers. He has had large
experience in the affairs of government, and, added to this advantage,
he has the gift of diplomacy, these two factors accounting for the
prestige the Foreign Office enjoys under his administration. Since his
appointment as Foreign Minister, the question of boundaries,—which
constitutes the chief element of discord between South American
countries,—has approached nearer its final solution so far as Peru is
concerned, and friendly relations exist between that country and her
neighbors; though Chile still postpones the settlement of the Tacna and
Arica question, the plebiscite which was to have been held some years
ago not yet having taken place. The dependencies of the Foreign Office
in Europe and America have maintained the utmost concord with the
_Ministerio_, and the foreign diplomatic corps has cordially
reciprocated its friendly attitude. The Peruvian Minister to Washington,
Dr. Felipe Pardo, has been active in promoting good feeling between his
country and the United States; in conveying the invitation from the
Foreign Office to Mr. Root to visit Peru, in 1906, he did so in such
pleasing language that the great statesman referred to its gracious
character more than once, with evident appreciation.

[Illustration: THE PRESIDENT’S COACH LEAVING THE GOVERNMENT PALACE FOR
THE HOUSE OF CONGRESS.]

Dr. Carlos Washburn, the Minister of Justice, Public Instruction and
Worship, is President of the cabinet. His department supervises the
various judicial institutions, the plan of national education, and the
ecclesiastical government of the country. Dr. Washburn is a jurist of
eminent talent and has had a distinguished career in the administration
of justice. He was Judge of the Superior Court of Lima when called to
the higher post. During the present term, the department of justice has
established a superior court in Iquitos, and has instituted various
reforms. The publication of the judicial annals and the adoption of
regulations governing judicial statistics have been accomplished to
facilitate the public administration. Dr. Cavero, first vice-president
of the republic, and magistrate of the supreme court, with the
coöperation of a committee on legislative procedure, is occupied in the
preparation of a project for the reform of the penal code, a work for
which his great experience and superior knowledge particularly qualify
this learned statesman. The penitentiary and the boys’ correctional
school are conducted under the supervision of the Minister of Justice.
Improvements have been effected in both these institutions, the former
having been enlarged and modern accommodations added during the present
administration, while the latter has extended its beneficent influence
more widely than ever, giving to a class of boys most lacking in
training the advantages of learning a trade and becoming worthy
citizens. The school provides manual work for its inmates, who, as a
rule, are apt and diligent; the average “bad boy” is usually possessed
of extraordinary energy, and it is the aim of this school to direct it
to a worthy purpose. It is one of the most successful reformatories of
South America, and the work done in carpentry, tailoring, shoemaking,
and other trades is creditable to the intelligence of the boys and to
the discipline of the school authorities.

One of the most important charges of the department under Dr. Washburn’s
administration is the national education, which has made remarkable
progress. In ecclesiastical matters, as pertaining to public worship,
this ministry has rendered valuable services to the established church,
apostolic prefectures, under instructions from this office, fulfilling
the requirements of ecclesiastical authority in the various departments.
On the death of Monseñor Tovar, Archbishop of Lima, Archbishop Naranjo
was appointed to the metropolitan See. The late archbishop was greatly
beloved by the nation and his death was an occasion of mourning
throughout the republic. Archbishop Naranjo, the illustrious prelate who
governs the archdiocese at present, is revered for his exemplary virtues
and highly esteemed for his scholarship.

Dr. German Schreiber, who succeeded Dr. Augusto Leguia as Minister of
Finance, is well equipped for the duties of his important office, having
had exceptional experience in financial administration previous to his
appointment to the post. This department of the government supervises
the national budget. Orders issued by the Ministers of State on the
national treasury can be paid only with a warrant drawn on the Minister
of Finance, this document showing the number of the corresponding item
in the budget, or containing the supreme decree authorizing the payment.
Each _Departamento_ keeps its own accounts, which assures regularity in
the expenses of the different prefectures. The reorganization of the
custom house service has received the especial attention of the Finance
Minister, with satisfactory results.

Under the head of Government and Home Affairs, Dr. German Arenas
supervises legislative matters, public order, political administration,
government buildings, etc., and the postal and telegraph service. The
development of industry and wealth has naturally given rise to greater
ambition among the laboring classes, and the struggle between capital
and labor has brought about occasional _huelgas_, or “strikes,” in the
larger cities; but the authorities have been able to avoid any violent
attacks on property, and public tranquillity has been easily restored.
The police system, reorganized and reinforced by a large number of
mounted troops, is better prepared than ever before to maintain respect
for the law.

[Illustration: MONUMENT TO BOLOGNESI.]

The modern improvements made in the postal service by the present
executive have been demanded as the result of a remarkable increase in
correspondence passing through the various post offices of the country.
During the past year, the general post office has increased its capacity
and new branches have been established in numerous districts of all the
Departamentos of the republic. Great obstacles have been overcome in
placing the post office on the present high plane of efficiency. The
vast extent of territory traversed by mountain ranges and cut by immense
cañons has made the question of postal delivery an exceptionally hard
problem to the government, as the expenses of maintaining the service
were formerly far in excess of the receipts. Owing to the expansion of
trade, the increase of population, and the careful attention lately
given to this branch of the administration, the post office has shown a
surplus of receipts over expenditures during the past three years. Peru
is a member of the Universal Postal Union, and its relations with the
post offices of foreign countries are maintained with great credit to
its government. The issue of post office orders and the service of
parcels post have been established between Peru and the United States,
England, and Bolivia, arrangements being under way to extend these
advantages to Italy, Japan, and Chile.

The telegraph service extends from one end of Peru to the other, the
capital being united by wire with the most remote departments of the
republic. The system covers more than three thousand miles of telegraph
wires. The first line in Peru was constructed by private enterprise in
1864 between Lima and Callao, the government assuming the administration
of the public telegraphs in 1875. The national wires connect at the
boundary line with those of neighboring republics, making a general
South American system.

The Minister of War and Marine, General Juan N. Eléspuru, is a
distinguished soldier and statesman, universally admired for his
military talent and the noble qualities of his character. His
administration is devoted especially to those matters which tend to the
elevation of the army, and particularly to its education. Civil as well
as military instruction is provided in the quartel, and the standard of
training in the military schools is higher than it has ever been. The
French military commission, engaged in 1896 to reorganize the army,
under the direct authority of the War Office, has accomplished an
important work, with the entire approval of the government. The head of
the commission, Brigadier-general Pablo Clement, is chief of the general
staff and is consulted on all matters relating to the instruction and
organization of the army. One of the captains of the commission has
charge of the Military High School, and another, of the Military
Academy, in Chorillos. The latter, created for the technical and
practical instruction of commissioned and non-commissioned officers
destined to serve in the army, has been most important in increasing the
efficiency of the military service. Annexed to the Military Academy is a
school of musketry for technical instruction in the use of portable
arms. The preparatory school and the school of application afford
instruction for beginners.

[Illustration: THE WAR ARSENAL, LIMA.]

[Illustration: INFANTRY UNIFORM, PERUVIAN ARMY.]

The army consists of six battalions of infantry; a regiment of mountain
artillery, a group of field artillery, and a group of artillery of
sappers and miners; and six squadrons of cavalry, including the
president’s escort. The various auxiliary corps include the general
commissary of the army, the ordnance store, the military health
department, and a supreme military and naval council. The infantry arms
are Mauser rifles of seventy-five millimeters calibre; the cavalry and
mountain artillery carry the carbine of the same model, the artillery
having also field batteries formed of the latest Schneider-Canet guns.
Military service is obligatory on all Peruvians between nineteen and
fifty years of age, excepting directors of public schools, college
professors and all who hold a diploma, exercising a liberal profession.
The organization of the reserves and their mobilization is regulated by
the establishment in each Department of battalions of sappers,
consisting of four hundred and forty-eight men, and, in eleven
Departments, of cavalry squadrons of one hundred and sixty-nine men.
Peruvians from thirty-five to fifty years of age form the national
guard. By the well-regulated system of conscription in force, Peru will
have in a few years, in addition to its well-drilled army, a host of
instructed reserves, requiring only a few drills to transform them into
able soldiers. The republic is divided into four military zones, the
capitals being Piura in the northern, Lima in the central, Arequipa in
the southern, and Iquitos in the eastern zone. These districts are
subdivided into eleven commands, composed of twenty-two departments and
colonies. Under the direction of the army authorities, troops of mounted
police, numbering two thousand two hundred men, serve in each
department.

The navy, which, like the army, is a dependency of the War Office, has
now three cruisers and three transports, and its reconstruction has been
accompanied by the organization of a Naval School, under the direction
of an officer of the French Navy. In this institution students are given
the professional, theoretical, and military instruction necessary to
qualify them as midshipmen, three years’ service qualifying for the rank
of sub-lieutenant. On board the training ship _Constitucion_, civil,
professional, naval, and military instruction is provided, after which
the _practicante_ passes to the vessels of the squadron, wherein he
serves for five years. At present three Peruvian midshipmen are
completing their practical instruction on board United States warships,
and seven are gaining experience in the Royal Spanish Navy.

[Illustration: MR. ROOT AT THE NATIONAL CLUB, LIMA.]

The progressive policy of President Pardo’s government is nowhere more
conspicuously seen than in the Department of Public Works. The minister,
Dr. Delfin Vidalón, last year published the report of his office in a
volume of six hundred pages, every line of which bore reference to
important industrial, commercial, or benevolent reforms in the numerous
sections subject to his administration. In the direction of Fomento,
which includes all matters relating to agriculture, mines, immigration,
and various industries, as well as benevolent institutions, the amount
of labor accomplished is phenomenal. Public works have been carried out
on a vast scale, and in accordance with the most modern ideas. Railways,
port works, and irrigation have occupied the best engineers of the
government. Sanitation and hygiene, an important charge of this office,
have received especial attention. The wireless telegraph, or radiograph,
has been installed in the Amazon region, and successful experiments have
been made in the use of this method of transmitting messages across the
virgin forests of the tropics. A German company has successfully
established radiographic communication from Puerto Bermudez on the river
Pichis to Masisea on the Ucayali, this being the first attempt ever made
to cross a territory densely covered by tropical vegetation. Two
stations have been built, of three towers, each one hundred and fifty
feet in height. The system is now being extended to Iquitos on the
Amazon River. The question of public health is recognized by the
government as of paramount importance to the well-being of the state,
and the Department of Public Health has recently been made a dependency
of the Ministry of Fomento. It is divided into two sections, hygiene and
demography, and has the supervision of sanitary corps, vaccination, and
all lazarettos of the republic. The sanitary corps have charge of the
inspection of the ports,—the maritime sanitary defence being governed by
regulations of the sanitary police, in accordance with the International
Sanitary Convention held in Washington,—and sanitary stations are
established at Paita, Ilo, and Callao. By this new organization, the
means of guarding the health of the community is greatly simplified.
Vaccination is obligatory in Peru. Sanitary inspection governs railway
as well as steamboat traffic. The results are better health conditions
in all the cities.

[Illustration: THE CENTRAL MARKET, LIMA.]

The four years during which President Pardo has governed Peru have been
marked by events of the greatest significance, not only in the history
of that republic but in the annals of South American politics. The visit
of Secretary Root of the United States in 1906 and the passing of the
great Atlantic Squadron in 1908, are incidents that deserve to be
recorded. Especially is this true as regards Peru. The visit of
Secretary Root was more than a part of the programme carried out by that
distinguished statesman in his tour of South America. It was, as he
himself expressed it, when responding to the spontaneous and generous
welcome given him by the Peruvian people, the renewal of an old,
constant, and cordial friendship between the Peruvian people and their
cousins of the United States. He said: “I have come here, not to look
for new friends, but to salute the old ones; not to initiate any new
policy, but to follow up the old and honored course; and on coming to
South America, responding to the invitations from the different
countries, going down by the eastern coast and coming up by the western,
to pass by Peru without stopping here would make my trip as incomplete
as a representation of Shakespeare’s ‘Hamlet’ without the appearance of
Hamlet on the stage.” This frank expression of friendship was genuinely
appreciated, as it showed that the warm sentiments which found voice in
President Pardo’s address of welcome were thoroughly reciprocated.
Nothing could have been more pleasing to Mr. Root than the following
words, from the president’s speech: “These sentiments of sympathy and
admiration shone forth at the dawn of Independence, because the founders
of the Great Republic pointed out to our ancestors the way that led to
freedom; and they have been gaining strength since the first days of our
autonomic existence, owing to the bond which the admirable foresight of
another great statesman of your country extended over this American
land.”

[Illustration: PERUVIAN MARINES.]

Mr. Root’s visit to Peru was an occasion of great interest to the North
American statesman, who had an opportunity to become acquainted with the
various important institutions of the country. A special session of the
Senate, under the presidency of Dr. Manuel Barrios, was held to receive
Mr. Root. On the day preceding his visit to the Senate, Secretary Root
was elected an honorary member of the Faculty of Political and
Administrative Sciences of the University, founded by President Pardo’s
father. This impressive ceremony was performed in the presence of the
entire University, presided over by its president, Dr. Villarán, and the
Deans of the Faculties, and attended by the President of the Republic,
the Cabinet Ministers, and the Military Staff of his Excellency. To a
statesman and scholar of Mr. Root’s experience and knowledge, it was
both a pleasure and a profit to receive the many gracious assurances of
appreciation which were extended to him in Peru; and in return, the
Peruvian people had the satisfaction of learning the opinion of an
eminent foreigner regarding their political and educational advancement.
Mr. Root found the evidences of progress most creditable to the nation,
and said that the difference between the country to-day and what it was
a generation ago was as great as the difference marked by centuries in
the history of European countries. The cordial relations existing
between the two countries, more firmly united than ever by the visit of
Secretary Root, were still further strengthened when the American
Squadron arrived at Callao. Its officers and crew were received by the
citizens of that port and of the capital with the heartiest
demonstrations of welcome. The entertainment of the fleet devolved upon
the Foreign Office, and Dr. Polo interpreted the wishes of the president
and of the nation by extending to Admiral Evans and his officers every
courtesy and attention that an appreciative host could bestow on a
welcome guest.

The secret of the sympathy existing between Peru and the United States
lies largely in the similarity of the national ideals, which in both
countries are centred in liberal principles of civil government. The
Civil party which elected President Pardo stands for the most
progressive politics of Peru. The illustrious statesman who presides
over its councils at present, Dr. Augusto Leguia, has just received the
highest proof of the nation’s esteem for his genius and patriotism, in
the announcement of his election to succeed Dr. Pardo as President of
Peru. The election took place in May, 1908, and the successful candidate
is to be inaugurated on the 24th of September, 1908. The president-elect
is one of Peru’s greatest men, his name being especially identified, as
Finance Minister, with the successful financial operations of the
present government during the first three years of Dr. Pardo’s term; his
knowledge of all that pertains to this important branch of the
government is unequalled by that of any other Peruvian statesman. A
gentleman of distinguished family and most attractive personality, as
well as a statesman of extraordinary ability, Dr. Leguia is a worthy
successor of President Pardo, who by his admirable qualities of mind and
heart has endeared himself to all Peruvians and won the respect and
esteem of all foreigners in his country.

                               CHAPTER XI
               THE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION OF THE REPUBLIC


[Illustration: A REVIEW OF THE TROOPS, LIMA.]

The national constitution, on which is based the present political
organization of Peru, stands a lasting monument to the patriotism and
genius of the statesmen in whose hands was placed the responsibility of
framing it, and does credit to the democratic principles of the nation
whose sovereign will is manifested in its laws and provisions. For
nearly half a century, the government of Peru has been building its
strength on this solid foundation of broad purpose and practical ideals,
and to-day the aspirations of its rulers are being realized with
ever-increasing success. The aim of the present administration,
admirably expressed by one of the leading statesmen of Peru, is that of
a modern people striving to attain their highest welfare and
aggrandizement: “To develop the immense resources and wealth with which
nature has so wonderfully endowed the land; to render the territory
accessible to labor and civilization by opening up means of
communication, granting all kinds of facilities and giving security for
the life, health, and welfare of the inhabitants, in order to obtain the
population that large territories require; to educate and instruct the
people, making them understand their personality, their liberty, their
duties, and their rights; to develop their faculties and energies, their
labor forces, their industrial and commercial capacity and power,
elevate their moral dignity, consolidate and strengthen the national
unity, insure definitely the government of the people, of justice, of
order, and of peace; to attract capital and foreign immigration, develop
and give impulse to the commercial relations with other countries,
maintain a frank and true harmony and international solidarity, respect
all mutual and reciprocal rights, and resolve all disagreements by
friendly, just and honorable means; to perform, in short, a work of
human civilization.”

[Illustration: HIS EXCELLENCY DR. AUGUSTO B. LEGUIA, ELECTED PRESIDENT
OF PERU 1908–1912, TO BE INAUGURATED SEPTEMBER 24, 1908.]

The national constitution of Peru declares the form of government to be
republican, democratic, and representative, based on the unity of the
three governing bodies, the executive, legislative, and judicial, each
independent of the other in exercise of its authority. The executive
power is charged with the duty of guarding the general interests of the
nation, by carrying out the purposes of the constitution through a
correct and capable administration of public affairs, the president of
the republic being the chief executive, assisted by six ministers of
State, who direct the departments of Foreign Affairs; Government and
Home Affairs; Justice, Worship and Public Instruction; War and Marine;
Finance and Commerce; and Public Works and Promotion. The first and
second vice-presidents, who are called upon to perform the duties of
president under circumstances set forth in the constitution, are elected
simultaneously with the president and in the same form, their official
term covering four years, as does that of the president. The
qualifications necessary to entitle a citizen to become president are,
that he shall be a Peruvian by birth, not less than thirty-five years of
age, and have resided at least ten years in the country. As stated
elsewhere he cannot be reëlected president, nor can he be elected
vice-president, until the expiration of an intervening term.

[Illustration: DR. EUGENIO LARRABURE Y UNÁNUE, ELECTED VICE-PRESIDENT
FOR THE TERM 1908–1912.]

The legislative power is exercised by Congress, composed of two
chambers, the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Senators are elected
by the departments (the largest and most important of the territorial
divisions), each department being entitled to from one to four
senatorial representatives, according to the number of its provinces. In
order to be eligible for the Senate, a candidate must be over
thirty-five years of age. The Chamber of Deputies consists of as many
representatives as there are provinces or territories of from fifteen
thousand to thirty thousand inhabitants. Both senators and deputies are
elected for a term of six years by direct vote, both must be Peruvian
citizens, born in Peru; and a deputy must be at least twenty-five years
of age. The president of the republic, vice-presidents, ministers of
state, prefects and sub-prefects of departments and the governors of
provinces are ineligible to membership in the legislature until two
months after leaving their executive offices; the same applies to the
judiciary and to all public employés under the direct authority of the
executive; ecclesiastics cannot represent the departments or provinces
of their diocese. The regular sessions of Congress are opened on the
28th of July each year, the term lasting for ninety days; extraordinary
sessions may be convoked by the executive, with no stated period of
duration, though they cannot be continued over a term of more than
forty-five days.

The judicial power of the government is administered by a Supreme Court,
established in Lima, and nine superior courts, which are installed in
Lima, Cuzco, Arequipa, Puno, Ayacucho, Cajamarca, Huaraz, Trujillo,
Piura, and Iquitos; each of these courts has jurisdiction over one or
more departments. The court of Tacna, which performed its labors until
the period of the war of the Pacific, is still in recess, and judicial
questions arising in the section subject to Peruvian authority are
brought before the court of Arequipa. In almost all the provinces there
are judges of the first instance, and in all districts are justices of
the peace.

[Illustration: THE MILITARY SCHOOL, CHORILLOS.]

In accordance with the national constitution, the local government of
the republic is under the direction of departmental and municipal
boards. The departmental board has its headquarters in the capital of
the _Departamento_, as this division is named in Peru; its duties are to
attend to the service of public works, public instruction, and works of
the benevolent societies, and to revise the acts of the municipal
boards. The members of the departmental boards are delegates elected by
the provincial councils, as the municipal boards of provinces are
called; the municipal boards of the districts into which the provinces
are subdivided are known as district councils. The provincial council is
composed of citizens elected by the people, foreigners having the right
to vote and being eligible for election; from among its members are
chosen the mayor, vice-mayor, two recorders who administer the finances
of the municipality, and a number of inspectors who superintend its
various branches of public service. All these posts are unsalaried. The
district council is composed of the mayor, or alcalde, two aldermen
elected by the people, and two recorders appointed by the provincial
council. The duties of both the provincial and district councils are to
govern the towns of their jurisdiction as regards sanitation, hygiene,
the supply of water and lighting, the superintendence of public roads,
markets, street cars and other conveyances, public amusements, etc.;
they also have charge of the civil register and statistics. Primary
instruction and the police service are not under the direction of the
municipal boards, but under the supreme government. The revenues of
provincial and district councils are derived from municipal properties,
and chiefly from local taxes called _arbitrios_, which are imposed with
the approval of the supreme government. The proceedings of the district
councils are revised by the provincial councils, whose acts are, in
turn, subject to revision by the departmental boards.

[Illustration: DR. SOLÓN POLO, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS IN PRESIDENT
JOSÉ PARDO’S CABINET.]

Politically, the republic is divided into twenty-two departments, two of
which, Moquegua and Tumbes, known as littoral provinces, consist each of
a single province only. The departments are subject to the authority of
a prefect, who is appointed by the executive, receiving his instructions
from the minister of government. The departments are subdivided into one
hundred and one provinces, governed by sub-prefects, and the provinces
are again subdivided into eight hundred and one districts, under the
authority of governors. By this arrangement the supreme government
maintains immediate control of the national interests in every part of
the republic, the prefects, sub-prefects, and governors having direct
supervision of primary instruction and the police service within their
respective jurisdictions. The recent reorganization of the police system
has brought notable improvements into the service, which is conducted in
conformity with modern regulations.

The ecclesiastical authority is exercised in accordance with the
national constitution, which states that Roman Catholicism is the
established religion, freedom of worship being permitted to
non-Catholics. The church territory is divided into nine dioceses: the
archbishopric of Lima, and the bishoprics of Trujillo, Chachapoyas,
Huaraz, Huánuco, Ayacucho, Cuzco, Puno, and Arequipa. These are again
divided into curacies, of which Lima has sixty-six, Trujillo one hundred
and three, Chachapoyas forty-three, Huaraz forty-seven, Huánuco
fifty-seven, Ayacucho ninety-two, Cuzco eighty-two, Puno fifty-two, and
Arequipa seventy-one, making in all six hundred and thirteen, in charge
of curate-vicars, who receive their instructions from the bishops of the
diocese to which they are appointed. Every village in the republic has
its church or chapel and religious instruction is given to every
citizen, the churches being open at all hours of the day to admit anyone
who wishes to consecrate a few moments to devotions.

[Illustration: DR. CARLOS WASHBURN, PRESIDENT OF DR. PARDO’S CABINET.]

The civil rights of all persons are respected in Peru without
distinction of nationality, and all who reside in the country are
equally protected by its laws. Any foreigner may acquire property in
Peru and dispose of it at will; in general, everything concerning landed
property is amply guaranteed by the Peruvian laws. The Thirty-second
Article says: “The laws protect and oblige all persons equally; and the
civil rights are independent of the quality of the citizen.” The
Twenty-eighth Article declares that “every foreigner can acquire, in
accordance with the laws, landed property in the republic, possessing in
everything relating to that property the same obligations and privileges
as a Peruvian.” Special dispositions expressly authorize foreigners to
denounce mines and obtain concessions of mountain and rubber lands on
the same conditions as Peruvians. In the exercise of any trade,
profession or industry of any kind, absolute freedom is permitted to
native and foreigner alike, so long as it is not opposed to morality,
health or public security. Foreigners desiring to practise medicine,
law, or engineering are required to prove their ability by presenting
their title received from a university, and by submitting to the
prescribed examination. In order to guarantee the titles of land owners,
a registry office has been recently established, in which is inscribed
the name of the actual owner, the manner in which the property was
acquired, the incumbrances attaching to its purchase, if any, and any
conditions which limit the possessor’s right to dispose of it. The Civil
Code recognizes the right of a foreigner to dispose of his property by
will, and, in case of his dying without having made a will, and without
leaving immediate heirs, it provides for placing the property in
security, under the direction of the consular representative of the
nation to which the deceased belonged; an inventory is taken and the
inheritance liquidated, so that claims against it may be presented in
due form, after the settlement of which the balance is handed over to
the heirs legally entitled to receive it. As regards the personal
liberty of foreigners as well as Peruvians, the Eighteenth Article of
the Constitution expressly says that no one can be arrested without a
written order from a competent judge, or from the authorities charged
with the preservation of public order, except in cases of _flagrante
delicto_, and in any case the person arrested must be brought before the
judge of the case within twenty-four hours afterward. The law of _habeas
corpus_ is recognized, by which anyone detained more than twenty-four
hours without having his case submitted to the proper authorities may
present himself, or be represented by a proxy, before the judge with a
complaint, and the judge is bound to investigate the arrest and to
decree the liberty of the detained person in case no legal reason for
his further detention can be established.

[Illustration: THE MINT, LIMA.]

Naturalized foreigners enjoy the rights and are subject to the
obligations imposed upon Peruvians, except that they cannot be elected
to the presidency of the republic, or be ministers of State, Senators,
deputies, or judicial authorities, though they may be appointed justices
of the peace. The children of foreigners are, if born in the country,
Peruvians by birth, provided their names be inscribed in the Civil
Register. A Peruvian woman follows the nationality of her husband,
though, should she become a widow, she again assumes the nationality of
her birth. It is important for foreigners who contemplate living in Peru
to know that civil marriage is established for non-Catholics, who may
celebrate the marriage ceremony before the mayor of the place in which
either of the contracting parties resides, in the presence of two
witnesses who must be residents of the same locality. It is necessary
only that a declaration be made before the mayor that they do not belong
to the Catholic community, or that they have separated from it. It is
obligatory that the Act of Marriage shall be inscribed in the Civil
Register within eight days after the ceremony, even in the case of those
who are married according to the religion of the country. The divorce
court is unknown in Peru, the only legal separation being one which
dissolves the union only so far as regards the property, the marriage
tie remaining in force. In the case of non-Catholics, the civil courts
decide as to the judicial separation or nullity of the marriage, while,
for Catholics, the ecclesiastical authorities dispose of the matter in
accordance with the ruling of the Council of Trent.

The new laws that have been introduced from time to time in the national
code show a spirit of fraternity in the Peruvian character which is
particularly promising for the development of friendly foreign
relations. In the liberal mining laws, the enterprising prospector from
abroad finds every facility to aid him in his ambitious undertakings;
and in the laws governing colonization, the establishment of industries,
or any foreign enterprise, the conditions are as favorable as a
progressive and far-seeing policy could make them. A description of this
richly dowered country will show that its society, its intellectual and
benevolent institutions, its industries and its growing trade, are the
outward expression of a people’s faith in their political security and
the wisdom of their laws.

                              CHAPTER XII
            THE CITY OF THE KINGS AND ITS BEAUTIFUL SUBURBS


[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO MUNICIPAL PARK.]

With an inheritance of legend, romance, and wealth that gives its
history extraordinary charm, Lima, “The Thrice-crowned City,” enjoys the
distinction of being the most renowned capital of Spanish America. For
nearly three hundred years it was the “second metropolis” of the vast
Spanish empire on two continents, and the centre of a viceregal court
whose splendor and gayety vied with that of royalty itself. The legend
of Rimac makes the site of this beautiful city the ancient abode of a
revered pre-Incaic oracle; and the imagination can easily picture scenes
of antiquity in the valley “that speaks,” when from all parts of the
kingdom the faithful came to make their vows and to receive the word of
the American Delphi, ages before Pizarro laid the foundations for the
City of the Kings. As frequently occurred in Peru, the native title
superseded the Spanish one, and “Lima,” which is a corruption of
“Rimac,” is now the name universally given to the capital that was more
pompously christened “La Ciudad de los Reyes,” the arms being three gold
crowns on an azure field with the Star of the East above.

Lima stands on the left bank of the Rimac River in a broad and fertile
plain, which slopes gently to the Pacific Ocean, a few miles away. The
great chain of the Andes passes within fifty miles of the city; and
spurs from this majestic range approach close to its gates, forming an
amphitheatre within which the capital lies, wearing a purple crown at
dawn when the sun is hidden behind its hills, and a golden aureole at
eventide when the light fades into the sea. The city forms a triangle,
of which the longest side rests on the River Rimac; the streets are
marked out in a straight line and run parallel from northeast and
northwest, crossing at right angles, with open squares, or _plazas_, at
intervals, beautified with monuments, fountains, and shrubbery. The
Plaza Mayor, or principal square of Lima, is about five hundred feet
above sea level, the mountains behind the city reaching an altitude of
from one thousand to three thousand feet; the climate is mild, rain
seldom falls, and the surrounding hills keep off northerly and easterly
winds, while cool breezes from the Pacific temper the heat of the
tropics.

In appearance and style, the Lima of the viceroyalty has been compared
with Seville, except that its streets were broader and straighter than
those of the Andalusian metropolis, and showed signs of greater
activity. As the capital of the republic, the city has grown larger,
more modern in appearance, and more western in atmosphere; yet there is
still much of the charm of the past in the massive street doors, barred
windows and Moorish balconies, or _miradores_, some of them built of
mahogany and carved in handsome designs. The _portales_, arcades that
extend along the sides of the plazas, forming a sheltered walk in front
of the shops, and usually thronged with people, are a survival of
colonial architecture. The old churches and convents retain the
attractiveness of venerable edifices which have served as places of
devotion for many generations. All these features are too charming to be
dispensed with, and it is to be hoped that the necessities of modern
improvement will not soon demand their destruction.

What scenes are suggested by the beautiful Plaza Mayor! On the north
side stands the government palace, once the palace of the viceroys,
whose court was the talk of two continents during the rule of the
Marquis de Cañete, the Duke de Palata, and the dilettante Prince de
Esquilache; in its spacious salons gay festivals were celebrated by the
Viceroy Amat and his courtiers. A short distance away is the site of the
assassination of Pizarro; and, overlooking the plaza, from the eastern
side, the great cathedral turns one’s thoughts back to those early days
when its first foundations were laid by the Conqueror, whose remains it
shelters. The archbishop’s palace adjoins the cathedral. On the western
side of the plaza stands the city hall, both the western and southern
sides being faced by handsome _portales_, above which are the balconies
of the principal social clubs.

The brilliant functions of the viceroy’s court, that illuminated the
palace on the north side of the plaza a century ago, could hardly have
been more elaborate or more elegant than the entertainments which are
given to-day in the handsome quarters of the Union Club, overlooking the
plaza from the opposite side, or in the Nacional Club, a few blocks
away. The balls and banquets held by these societies in honor of
distinguished visitors are memorable affairs: as when Mr. Root was
entertained with true Peruvian hospitality in a series of brilliant
social events under their auspices. The beautiful bronze fountain, more
than two hundred and fifty years old, which forms the centre-piece of
the great plaza, is an ornament of rare value. A short distance from the
square is located the Plaza de la Inquisicion, where, during the
viceroyalty, the tribunals of the Inquisition were held. The building in
which the Holy Office had its court is now the Senate Chamber of the
republic. The interior of this edifice possesses peculiar interest. The
ceiling is of carved mahogany, a magnificent example of workmanship; the
mahogany table used to-day by the honorable Senate when writing the laws
that govern a free people is the same on which the death warrant was
signed in the tyrannous period of the _auto de fé_. In the centre of
this plaza stands an equestrian statue erected to immortalize the hero
of the Independence, Simon Bolivar. The statue, superbly sculptured, is
of bronze, and rests on a pedestal of white marble, with _bas-reliefs_
on the sides, representing the battles of Junin and Ayacucho.

Lima has not been forgetful of the heroes of her liberty. In the
beautiful Plaza de la Exposicion, at the entrance to the Paseo Colón, a
handsome marble column stands to honor the memory of the other
Liberator, General San Martin. It was presented to the city of Lima by a
patriotic Peruvian, Colonel Lorenzo Pérez Roca. The lower terminus of
the Paseo Colón, where Lima’s fashionable driveway widens at the
converging of six beautiful avenues, is marked by a spacious circle,
that provides an imposing site for one of the most notable monuments in
South America, erected recently to commemorate the sacrifice of the
glorious hero, Colonel Bolognesi, on the heights of Arica, where, having
given his answer when asked to surrender—“Not till I have burned my last
cartridge!”—he fell under the enemy’s fire. The monument is the work of
the Spanish sculptor, Querol. It rests on steps of granite, the base
being a granite block, supporting a column of white marble. Around the
base are allegorical scenes, and the capital is also artistically
finished in allegorical design. The statue which surmounts the column
represents the hero in the act of falling, mortally wounded, with his
country’s flag held close to his heart. Another handsome monument in the
Paseo Colón is dedicated to Christopher Columbus, for whom the driveway
is named. It is of white marble, and was designed by the Italian
sculptor, Salvatore Revelli, the same model having been used for the
monument in the port of Colón, Panamá. On the road to Callao, a
magnificent column of Carrara marble, seventy-five feet high, and
crowned by a statue of Victory, commemorates the successful defence of
the port of Callao against the Spaniards on the 2d of May, 1866.

[Illustration: PLAZUELA DE LA RECOLETA.]

The dividing line between the Lima of the viceroyalty and the Lima of
the republic is nowhere more evident than in the appearance of the
city’s popular driveways and promenades. The Paseo Colón is the modern
fashionable residence quarter, and the favorite resort for the best
society of Lima on the afternoons of the _Corso_. It is about half a
mile long and one hundred and fifty feet wide, extending from the Plaza
de la Exposicion to the Plaza Bolognesi. Along the middle of the
driveway, from one end to the other, runs a garden bordered with trees,
flowers, and shrubs, divided at intervals by monuments, pillars, and
fountains, and overarched throughout by artistically arranged wires for
electric lights; at night when these successive arches are illuminated,
the Paseo is a brilliant scene, presenting an extraordinary effect.
Stone pavements extend along each side of the central garden, for the
use of foot passengers; and the broad avenue, with its pleasant driveway
thus divided, is adorned by a double line of handsome residences that
overlook it from both sides. Adjoining the Plaza de la Exposicion, at
the head of the Paseo, is the large and beautiful Exposition Park, named
in commemoration of the General Exposition of 1870, which took place in
these grounds. The park covers thirty acres, and is laid out in shaded
walks, artificial lakes, grottoes, gardens, and conservatories, in which
all kinds of tropical and sub-tropical plants and flowers are to be
seen, including choice Peruvian orchids. A circle of palm trees encloses
a pretty kiosk, always a favorite retreat, and several edifices in
various styles of architecture ornament the grounds. The Exposition
Palace stands at the entrance to the park, and is one of the handsomest
buildings in Lima. Its lower floor is used for balls, concerts, and
lectures, the floor above being occupied by the National Museum, the
Historical Institute, and the Athenæum of Lima. It faces the Paseo
Colón, directly opposite to another handsome edifice, the Municipal
Institute of Hygiene.

[Illustration: STATUE OF COLUMBUS IN THE PASEO COLÓN.]

The Historical Institute is one of the most important scientific
institutions of Peru, and one destined to occupy a high place among the
societies of America. Its purpose is to cultivate and advance the study
of national history, including all that pertains to the ethnology and
archæology of the country. This embraces a wide field and opens up
illimitable prospects of investigation. The institute has charge of the
National Museum, which is the repository for collections of objects of
historical value and interest. The work of collecting, deciphering,
arranging, annotating, and publishing documents relating to the national
history, as well as the responsibility of guarding and preserving the
national monuments of archæological and artistic value, is under the
direction of the institute, which was created by decree of the
government of Peru on the 18th of February, 1905. Dr. Max Uhle has
charge of the prehistoric department of the museum, a section full of
interest for those who have a curiosity to see the wonderful potteries,
textiles, and mummies that have been taken from Peruvian burial mounds.
Although the work of classifying and arranging these relics of antiquity
was begun only a little more than a year ago, the exhibit is already
assuming great importance, and it will undoubtedly be among the famous
world collections one of these days. The collection of objects of the
colonial and the republican periods is of important historical interest.
Here may be seen curious relics of the time of the conquest, even the
first baptismal font used in Lima, which was presented to the museum by
the church of Santo Domingo. Many and varied articles belonging to the
period of the viceroyalty have been collected, among others, the wooden
cross that was carried at the head of the procession in the _auto de fé_
as early as the sixteenth century; and the splendid coach, red and gold,
with the Torre-Tagle arms emblazoned on its panels, in which the great
marquis made his magnificent progresses across the country, in royal
style, with outriders and lackeys in attendance. There are trophies of
the war of independence, among them Bolivar’s spurs and the bed on which
General Sucre is said to have slept the night before Ayacucho; and among
the precious treasures of more recent days are preserved the swords of
Colonel Bolognesi, the cap and epaulettes of Admiral Grau, a Chilean
flag and other souvenirs of the war of the Pacific. Paintings of
historical scenes and portraits of great men adorn the walls.

Leaving the modern Paseo Colón and Exposition Park, and crossing the
Rimac, one is again in the old city of the viceroys, the famous Avenida
de Acho extending along the river bank from the ancient stone bridge,
built in colonial days, to the modern structure called the Balta Bridge,
in honor of a former president of the republic. This avenue, the
fashionable promenade of the capital up to half a century ago, is
divided into three roadways, the central one, bordered with tall
poplars, being used for riding and driving, while those on each side are
reserved as walks. It is popular on holidays and is thronged on the days
of the bull fights. Of equal interest, historically, is the _Jardin de
los Descalzos_ (“Garden of the Barefooted Friars”), which is situated a
short distance beyond the Avenida de Acho, and just at the foot of the
Cerro de San Cristobal, a mountain that rises close behind the city. The
garden of the Descalzos extends along an avenue more than half a mile in
length, ornamented by twelve statues that represent the signs of the
zodiac, and it is beautified throughout its length by tropical trees and
plants, while at intervals are placed handsome urns and marble benches.
An iron railing, six feet high, surrounds the garden, and a beautiful
fountain at its terminus completes the harmony of the picture, which is
enhanced by the overshadowing Cerro, and the ancient church and convent
of Barefooted Friars, just below.

[Illustration: KIOSK OF PALMS, EXPOSITION PARK.]

With the destruction, a few years ago, of the walls that formerly
surrounded the city, plans for its beautification were initiated on an
extensive scale; the Boulevard Bolognesi, the Boulevard Grau and other
broad _paseos_ were laid out, forming an almost uninterrupted driveway
from the river around the city’s southern limits to the river again. The
Boulevard Grau passes the Botanical Garden, in which are collected
specimens of tropical and semi-tropical flora of every variety. Stately
palms guard the entrance to the garden, and bordering its shady walks
are beautiful plants and flowers in gorgeous colors and of wonderful
growth. The _Chusia_, a remarkable tree of which the fruit bursts open
when ripe, showing a pretty flower with scarlet seeds, is among the
interesting arboreal specimens seen here.

[Illustration: PAVILION IN EXPOSITION PARK.]

Beautiful _paseos_ also lead from Lima to its suburban watering places,
the Avenida de Magdalena being one of the most picturesque of these
shady drives. Another popular highway is the road from Lima to Callao,
along which the viceroys used to make their splendid processions in
former days. It is lined part of the way with shade trees and presents
an animated spectacle on feast days and holidays, though it is not so
generally used since the advent of the railway, as that service has
converted into a twenty minutes’ trip what was formerly a journey of
hours. It is the chosen route for farmers and fruitsellers on their way
to market, and is thronged in the early morning hours by these
picturesque venders, usually on donkeys, which bear the products in huge
panniers slung at each side. Lima has four market places, the Mercado
Concepcion being the largest and most important; it occupies an entire
block and has a spacious interior, two stories in height, admitting of
the best ventilation. It is considered one of the largest in South
America, both as regards the edifice and the abundance of the market
supply.

The scene at the market is bright and entertaining, as it is the
favorite meeting place for gossip among the market women, and one may
hear many a clever bit of repartee between the bargaining purchaser and
the nonchalant vender. Local color is vivid in the Mercado Concepcion,
as it is wherever there are popular gatherings of the mestizo and the
Indian, who give the dominant note; the customs of the Spanish-American
of to-day differ little from those of North America, whatever
differences exist being due to climate and temperament rather than to
traditions. The climate of Lima is very equable, the thermometer seldom
rising above seventy degrees or going below sixty degrees Fahrenheit, in
the shade. In winter, from May to November, the _garúa_, a damp fog,
prevails, arriving with the morning breeze, which blows from the
westward, but passing away when the sun is high, except on cloudy days.

[Illustration: CHURCH OF SANTO DOMINGO.]

As the capital of the republic, Lima is the chief centre of political as
well as social progress. The president of the republic, his ministers,
and the high officials of the various administrative offices reside in
Lima, in which are located the national treasury, the mint, and the post
office. The mint is an interesting institution, and visitors find its
archives both instructive and entertaining. The first money coined in
Lima consisted of silver disks, marked on both sides with a cross made
by means of a hammer; later, it was stamped with the royal arms on one
side and the bust of the reigning monarch on the other. Since the
inauguration of the republic, the mint has been entirely reorganized,
and provided with modern machinery, constructed in England. It occupies
the same site as the original building, erected in 1565. The records of
the establishment show that four hundred million silver coins have been
turned out in that time, besides gold pieces. At present both gold and
silver money is coined, the gold pieces being the _libra_ and the _media
libra_ (pound and half pound), equivalent to the English sovereign and
the half sovereign; the silver coins are the _sol_, equivalent to half a
dollar gold, and the smaller pieces, the one-half _sol_, the one-fifth
_sol_, the _real_ (worth five cents, gold), and the one-half _real_.
Copper coins are used, equivalent in value to the English half-penny and
farthing. The Lima Mint is to-day one of the best establishments of its
kind in South America.

[Illustration: SAN PEDRO, THE FASHIONABLE CHURCH OF LIMA.]

Lima is the seat of Congress, of the Supreme Court, and of the general
staff of the army, the buildings in which these branches of the
government are conducted belonging, not to the municipality, but to the
nation. The construction of a new house of Congress is now occupying the
attention of the administration. The metropolitan dignitaries of the
Church also reside in Lima, His Grace Archbishop Garcia Naranjo, having
his palace next to the Cathedral. As Lima is not only the national
capital but also the capital of a department and of a judicial district,
it is the residence of the prefect and the seat of the superior courts.
It is, furthermore, the chief city of the province of Lima and the
headquarters of the sub-prefect, as well as of the staff of the six
police districts into which that service is divided. The provincial
council, or municipality, with all its dependencies, constitutes the
local government.

During the administration of the present mayor of Lima, Dr. Federico
Elguera, who was recently reëlected for the sixth time, in token of the
appreciation of the citizens for his good government, the municipal
improvements have been greater and more generally satisfactory than ever
before; and each year finds the city more modern in appearance, with
better sanitary conditions, and added conveniences of transportation.
The electric street car routes now cover the city very thoroughly and
connect it with the suburbs by means of a rapid and commodious service.
Electricity is also used for lighting, the system being modern and
convenient. As a metropolis, Lima provides the usual comforts of city
life, in good clubs and hotels; the cab service is excellent, the
telephone is found in all public buildings and residences; theatres are
open all the year, and a handsome new national theatre is now under
construction.

Lima has a population of one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants. The
general character of the masses is peaceable and the percentage of crime
is not large. The police service has been greatly improved during the
present administration, the mounted police being recruited and organized
by the army authorities, though serving under the orders of the chief of
police, who has charge of the entire force. The penitentiary of Lima,
the first of its class to be built in America, is a spacious edifice,
equipped with modern conveniences, including a complete system of
electric lighting; a good library was recently installed for the use and
education of the inmates. For protection against fires, Lima has a
volunteer brigade, the companies of which are maintained by personal
subscription. There are about five hundred volunteer firemen in the
capital, divided into companies, which, by their names, reveal the
cosmopolitan character of this service. In addition to the “Lima,”
“Salvadora,” and “Cosmopolita” companies, the brigade includes also the
“Roma,” “Francia,” “Victoria,” and others.

[Illustration: PASEO COLÓN—THE FAVORITE DRIVEWAY OF LIMA.]

Few capitals can boast of more delightful suburban resorts than those
which surround the Peruvian capital, making it possible for one to live
in a perennial paradise. In the mountains, a few leagues inland, is the
ideal climate of an altitude reaching from five thousand to eight
thousand feet above the sea, and tempered by its proximity to the
equator, so that, in winter, it is the most desirable place of residence
imaginable. Chosica and Matucana are destined to be renowned as popular
mountain resorts ere very long. Chosica is situated in the province of
Lima, on the line of the Oroya railway, two hours’ journey by train from
the capital. Many business men take their families to this resort, and
find it very convenient to reach their offices in town daily, as the
railway service is arranged to accommodate this demand. Matucana stands
at a much higher elevation, about eight thousand feet above sea level,
and is a couple of hours’ ride beyond Chosica on the same line of
railway. It is the capital of the province of Huarochiri, Department of
Lima, and is the political centre of an important district created
during the administration of Bolivar, who gave the citizens an
escutcheon with the inscription, “To the constant Patriots of
Huarochiri.” Matucana is quite a large town, and is increasing in
importance as the surrounding country is more generally explored for its
mines and other resources. Two trains daily each way carry passengers
between Lima and Matucana; many travellers bound for the sierra stop on
their way to enjoy a night’s rest at this healthful resort before
beginning the sharp ascent to the summit of the Andean range. The air is
fresh and cool, and one rarely suffers from _soroche_ at this altitude.
In summer, all Lima society deserts the capital to live at Chorillos,
Miraflores, Barranco, Magdalena, La Punta, Ancón, or some other of the
bathing resorts in its vicinity.

Chorillos is the Newport of Peru. Before the war with Chile it was the
wealthiest and most frequented summer resort in all South America; and,
even though it was completely reduced to ashes by the invading armies in
1881, it is to-day a beautiful suburb, having been almost entirely
rebuilt within the past twenty years. The site on which Chorillos is
built possesses advantages that are ideal for the purposes of a bathing
resort. Surrounding a sheltered cove that lies just under the brow of a
mountain two thousand feet high, called Morro Solar, is an uneven cliff,
rising at one point to a height of one hundred feet above the sea, and
here the city of Chorillos is situated. A beautiful terrace extends
along the edge of the cliff, where society gathers to enjoy the sea
breeze and to revel in the beauty of a Pacific sunset, under the warm
skies of the tropics.

The descent to the beach from the cliff is a picturesque and shaded
pathway, and the surf is particularly adapted for bathing, being smooth
and regular. The town has a population of three thousand, and in summer
the daily excursions from Lima bring many times that number to enjoy the
baths, the music, dances, boating, and other amusements. The Casino of
Chorillos is famous for its fashionable social affairs, and the Regatta
Club usually provides entertainments at intervals during the summer,
when Chorillos Bay is flecked with pretty white sails, launches, and
rowboats. Large and commodious electric cars run every few minutes
between Lima and Chorillos, the line having been recently extended to
reach another bathing resort, La Herradura, on the opposite side of the
Morro Solar, through which a tunnel has been built. Chorillos, Barranco,
and Miraflores are all connected with Lima by the same system of
railways. The distance between these resorts is very short and a shaded
driveway connects one with the other. Magdalena is situated between Lima
and Miraflores, and is reached by a separate car line; though the trip
may also be made by following the beautiful Avenida Magdalena, which
begins at the foot of the Paseo Colón, and extends all the way to
Magdalena.

La Punta, “The Point,” is another very popular bathing resort of Lima,
and it is growing in favor every year. It is located on the peninsula
which extends out into the sea at the port of Callao, and is frequented
by the people of Callao as well as those of Lima. Throngs of bathers
arrive by the trains that stop at La Punta every few minutes during the
day, and in the height of the summer season additional cars are put on
to accommodate the crowds. La Punta is located at the extremity of a
long narrow tongue of sandy beach, and cool breezes always blow across
it, refreshing and invigorating after the humid air of the capital.
Ancón, with its world-renowned necropolis of prehistoric treasures, lies
about twenty-five miles north of Lima, with which it is connected by
railway. It is quite popular as a bathing resort, and is a favorite
summer home for families; its climate is extremely healthful, and it is
regarded as a desirable place of residence most of the year. The dry
atmosphere and sandy soil are advantages always appreciated by invalids
suffering from pulmonary affections, and they are glad to enjoy the sea
air without the dampness that so often prevails at seaside resorts.

Whether in the charming capital, or in its picturesque and healthful
suburbs, the life of the Peruvian people is noted for its many agreeable
features, some of which are to be attributed to the blessings of climate
and the prodigality with which Nature has showered her wealth on the
land, though most of them are undoubtedly due to the amiable and
generous qualities of the people themselves, who have made their country
renowned abroad as the abode of an ever abundant and polite hospitality.

                              CHAPTER XIII
                    PERUVIAN HOSPITALITY AND CULTURE


[Illustration: A MODERN PRIVATE RESIDENCE OF LIMA.]

If the Spanish-Americans have inherited from their European ancestors
too much of the aristocratic pride and military arrogance that
distinguished Peninsular crusaders, they have also fallen heir to the
courtly grace and admirable _savoir faire_ which made the Knights of
Santiago and Alcantara famous among the first gentlemen of Europe four
centuries ago, and which, descending to their children’s children, have
become characteristic of the Spanish-speaking people all over the world.
In America, and more particularly in Peru, the influence of New World
conditions fostered a relaxation of austere exclusiveness and a
softening of military severity; the lavish opulence that reigned in the
viceroyalty, with its attendant pleasures, led colonial society to
assume a gayety and freedom which would have been impossible in the
atmosphere of rigorous etiquette that dominated Madrid, and Lima
gradually became more renowned for its sociability than for the
strictness of its court. Both influences may be seen, however, in the
development of the Peruvian society of to-day, which is reserved and
dignified in manner, clever, hospitable, and kind.

Although the national traits vary according to locality and inherited
tendencies, the inhabitants of the coast possessing characteristics
which are not so clearly defined in the people of the sierra, while
these again differ in their customs from their neighbors of the Amazon
valleys, yet, everywhere and at all times, the Peruvian’s _Mi casa es á
Và_—“My house is yours”—is a spontaneous word of welcome. The Limeños,
as natives of the capital are called, are noted for their _esprit_ and
imagination, and are especially gifted in the social qualities for which
their ancestors were celebrated a hundred years ago; while they are,
happily, outgrowing the heritage of less admirable tendencies,
bequeathed by the luxurious and extravagant society of the viceregal
court. The progress of the nation within the past half a century shows
that the race is strong, full of purpose, and capable of working out a
noble destiny. During the first twenty years of the republic, the social
life of Lima did not change greatly from what it had been in the
pleasure-loving court of the viceroyalty. Visitors to Peru in those
early times tell us that the propensity for card playing was one of the
greatest evils the new government had to combat, and that ministers,
envoys, and officers of all ranks fell under its spell. It is said that
the celebrated Baquijano once had to send for a bullock cart to take
home his winnings, amounting to more than thirty thousand dollars. The
chroniclers do not state whether the game resembled our modern poker or
our bridge whist! Those were the days when General San Martin gave his
assemblies at the palace once a week, and balls were held at which round
dances began to take the place of the _minuet_, the _mariquita_, and the
_fandango_. As the influence of the new régime made itself felt
everywhere, political and literary coteries lessened the number of card
parties and music and dancing became more popular in the houses of the
leading people.

It was not so easy to reform the custom, popular among the ladies of
those days, of wearing the _saya y manto_, a coquettish feminine dress
of the viceregal period, which had been under the ban of devout
churchmen for two hundred years before the independence. Its evil
influence seems to have been of a subtle kind, to judge from the
conflicting impressions it made on different travellers. It is described
by one who was in Lima a century ago and saw the ladies of that day
arrayed in all their charming grace and armed with their irresistible
coquetries, as “a very handsome and genteel costume;” though not all
foreigners described it in such moderate and conventional terms. The
_saya_ was a skirt of velvet, satin, or stuff, of black, purple, pale
blue, or other colors, sometimes striped; it was pleated in small folds
and clung to the figure in such a way as to display the contour to the
best advantage. Some of these _sayas_ were very narrow at the bottom so
that the wearer was obliged to take short steps in walking, a custom
that made the Limeña’s tiny feet look still smaller as she tripped
daintily along the street; the bottom of her _saya_ was often trimmed
with lace, fringe, pearls, or artificial flowers; the smaller her feet,
the richer and more elaborate was the garniture that bordered her
_saya_. With this garment went the _manto_, a hood of thin black silk
drawn around the waist and then carried over the head and held together
in front so as to hide all the face except one eye. It is said that in
this costume a lady could pass her most intimate friend without being
recognized, and mystery enveloped the identity of every feminine figure
seen on the street in those days. A dainty lace handkerchief, a rosary
in the hand, a glimpse of satin shoes and silk stockings, and an
abundance of jewels completed the toilette. The _manto_ was undoubtedly
derived from the Moors, and must have appeared a curious headdress when
seen for the first time. The Limeñas wore it in the most fascinating
style, and the one eye that was visible between its folds was made to do
double duty as a weapon of war or love. The secret of enhancing its
potent charm was as complicated as are the mysteries of the _tocador_ in
modern Spanish boudoirs. It was customary to darken the brows and
heighten the brilliancy of the eyes with cosmetics when Nature proved
unkind or too sparing of her favors; though it was the exception, as it
is to-day, when a Limeña’s eyes lacked beauty and brilliancy. Gradually
the _saya y manto_ gave place to the very full skirt and
mantilla,—similar to the costume still worn to church service. A long
war was waged against the _manto_ by the authorities of the viceroyalty,
who claimed that it fostered intrigue and a thousand dangerous
proclivities; but the wearers insisted that it protected their
complexion from the sun, and was necessary for their personal comfort as
well as convenience. As early as 1609 an attempt was made to prohibit
the _saya y manto_ in Lima, but not until it declined in fashion, more
than two hundred years later, did the Lima belles abandon this mode for
a more modern costume. It is said that the _saya y manto_ played a very
important part in the cause of independence, and that the wearers of
this effective disguise carried messages, assisted the patriots when
imprisonment or hardship overtook them, and rendered a great many
valuable services to the cause of liberty.

[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE BOTANICAL GARDEN, LIMA.]

[Illustration: GRAND STAND OF THE JOCKEY CLUB, LIMA.]

Many of the leading families of Peru are descendants of Spanish nobles
who came over with the viceroys, and a few trace their ancestry from the
conquerors; but the best fibre of the nation is derived from the
enterprising colonists who established commerce in the country during
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and by their industry and
practical energy laid the foundations for a better development of the
mercantile interests of Peru. They helped to overcome the traditional
feeling that it was beneath the dignity of a Spaniard to be employed
otherwise than as a statesman, a soldier, a scholar, or a priest; and
among the descendants of Spanish grandees are to be found to-day many
active and progressive bankers, merchants, constructing engineers, and
“captains of industry,” who are contributing to make Peru rich and
prosperous among the nations of the modern world. This spirit is more
generally seen in the capital and the seaports than in the cities of the
interior, though it is gradually extending to the remotest hamlets.

[Illustration: PRINCIPAL HALL OF THE INTERNATIONAL REVOLVER CLUB, LIMA.]

In Lima and Callao, increased attention is paid to business every year,
and the days of fiesta, which once numbered almost as many as those
devoted to work, are being constantly reduced, even the holidays that
remain, though none the less thoroughly enjoyed, having lost many
colonial features. Carnival, the gayest holiday festival of the year, is
now quite a subdued celebration compared with what it was in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when “Lima was no more than a city
of Andalusia transplanted to the New World, with all the extravagances
of the romantic, artistic, and audacious spirit of old Seville, Malaga,
and Cordova.” The freedom of the Carnival season then pervaded all ranks
of society, and for three days no one thought of anything but pleasure.
As late as the end of the eighteenth century, the mask and domino were
_costumes de rigueur_ for Carnival, and fancy dress balls were given in
many private residences. The Viceroy Amat made the Carnival season one
of unprecedented gayety, with bull fights, promenades in the Avenida de
Acho, and a _bal masque_ at night. One can imagine the charm of these
festivities in the delightful climate of Lima, with the soft music of
the guitar and the mandolin vibrating on the night air under a dozen
balconies, and the dance of the _mariquita_ and the _fandango_ keeping
time to a clicking of castanets in hundreds of gayly decorated _salas_.
The _saya y manto_ played its part, and many a jealous episode followed
the rivalry among young Limeños for the favor of a glance from the one
eye that looked out tantalizingly through a _tapada_. The custom of
deluging the passer-by with the contents of a water-jug was formerly
more general than it is to-day, when the little red _globo_ of scented
water is the chief weapon of Carnival sport. The _globo_, when filled,
is about one-fourth the size of a toy balloon, and is made of the same
material, breaking easily and splashing its contents over the victim at
whom it is thrown. Though Carnival is still a merry holiday, modern
municipal ordinances are annually restricting its more extravagant
features.

[Illustration: THE AMERICAN LEGATION AT LIMA.]

The national holiday, July 28th, the anniversary of Peruvian
independence, is celebrated with patriotic processions, speeches, and
entertainments; it is the opening day of Congress, and is always an
occasion of general festivity. The day begins, as do all public holidays
in Peru, with religious service in the Cathedral. There are eighteen
public holidays, two of which, Independence Day and the feast day of Our
Lady of Mercy, the patron saint of the arms of Peru, are recognized as
national. The feast of Our Lady of Mercy is held on the 24th of
September, and is celebrated with imposing church ceremonies and a
magnificent procession, in which the high church dignitaries, with the
Archbishop of Lima at their head, are present. The various religious
orders, including the Franciscan, Dominican, Augustinian, and others,
form part of the procession, and the army appears in gala uniform and
full force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The church service,
attended by the president of the republic and his cabinet, is one of
especial solemnity, and all Lima does homage to the occasion. The
streets and plazas are thronged by sunrise, an eager crowd assembling in
front of the government palace to see the president pass in his handsome
state coach drawn by eight horses and guided by a smart coachman and
grooms. Another annual feast day of importance, at least in the capital,
is the 30th of August, the day set apart for the celebration in honor of
Santa Rosa de Lima, the patron saint of Lima, the Philippines, and all
America. The birthday of St. Joseph (San José), the patron of the
republic of Peru, is celebrated on the 19th of March. The remaining
holidays are the same as those observed in all Catholic countries.

The hospitality of the Peruvians is especially seen in their homes,
where the stranger finds them thoughtful, courteous, and invariably
polite and attentive. One has here a good opportunity to learn the
family customs, which are simple and cordial. The houses of Peru are
generally of one or two stories, and are built around a court or
_patio_, which is usually beautified with plants and flowers and often
paved with ornamental tiles, making it a delightfully cool and
comfortable place for the family reunion in the evening. It takes the
place of the verandah, so popular in North America. The daily routine of
a Peruvian family does not differ greatly from that of the Latin people
in all countries, where the _desayuno_, or early breakfast, consists of
a cup of coffee and a roll, taken in one’s room, sometimes as early as
six o’clock, the midday meal, or breakfast proper, being much more
elaborate than the same meal in England or the United States, while the
dinner, between six and eight in the evening, is more or less the same
as in all countries. _Criollo_ cooking, as the preparation of food
according to Spanish-American taste is called, has given place in many
houses to the French _cuisine_, though one may still enjoy the peppery
dishes of native origin in the sierra, and a few choice specialties of
traditional excellence retain their hold on the national palate. The
after-dinner coffee is usually taken in the _patio_ in summer and in the
drawing-room during the season of the _garúa_. In the evening, music and
dancing are favorite amusements, the piano, guitar, mandolin, or other
musical instruments being among the necessities of every well-regulated
home. The foreigner is at once impressed by the refinement and grace
which distinguish the people in their home life, and which are evidences
of the long inheritance of a cultured race. Travellers have extolled the
people of Lima for their intelligence, imagination, and charming
hospitality; the _Arequipeños_ are eulogized by Flammarion, who says:
“Arequipa is the most agreeable place of abode in South America, not
only for the suavity of its climate but also because of the hospitable
customs of its people.” The cordiality of the families of Cuzco is no
less abundantly proved by those who have enjoyed a visit to this
historic city, in which it is the custom to extend charming hospitality
to the stranger. It is the same in the other cities of the republic,
where a kindly welcome awaits the visitor and every courtesy is shown to
the traveller.

[Illustration: PARK AT BARRANCO.]

The increasing population of foreigners in Peru, and the custom among
well-to-do Peruvians of sending their children to Europe and the United
States to complete their education has led to the introduction of more
cosmopolitan social customs than formerly existed, and this is seen
especially in the outdoor sports and amusements. Although the bull fight
and the Spanish game of _pelota_ still attract a large number of
spectators, the lawn tennis games are also popular; football and
baseball claim a great many enthusiastic Peruvian players, and regattas
are always attended by immense crowds of people. The horse races have
become a regular feature of sport, and at the _Cancha_, or race track,
on “Derby Day,” the best Lima society may be seen in its most
fashionable attire, which is usually of Parisian style and is often
imported direct from the French capital. The new president-elect of
Peru, Don Augusto Leguia, has a stock farm near the capital, on which
some of the best thoroughbreds of South America have been reared, and
his horses are usually among the favorite winners on Derby Day.

[Illustration: STAIRWAY OF THE NATIONAL CLUB, LIMA.]

Though most of the private fortunes of Limeños were swept away at the
time of the war with Chile, when the destruction of property was great
in Lima and its suburbs, as well as on the _haciendas_ of the wealthy
planters, yet the present generation has recovered a great deal of the
former prosperity, and at important social functions, such as the balls
given within the past two years to the Duke of the Abruzzi and Prince
Udine, of Italy, to General Saenz Peña of Argentina, and to Hon. Elihu
Root of the United States, the costumes and jewels displayed are of the
most costly and elegant description. The ladies of Lima have always been
famous for their winning and gracious manners, and every writer on Peru
has paid a compliment to their tiny feet, in which one traveller finds a
sufficient excuse for the _Q. b. s. p._ (“who kisses your feet”) with
which letters to ladies are usually finished in Spanish, instead of the
very matter-of-fact “Yours sincerely” that closes an epistle in English.
The Peruvian hostess entertains with the _grâce du salon_ which is hers
by inheritance, and her _tertulias_ are altogether charming. But she
does not confine her energies to social duties alone, her charities
occupying a great deal of attention. Three years ago, a number of ladies
of the best society of Lima formed a club, called the “Centro Social,”
for the purpose of establishing institutes in which the daughters of
gentlewomen without fortune could secure, free of charge, the necessary
training to fit them for earning their living. It was proposed to teach
stenography, bookkeeping, telegraphy, photography, drawing, and other
branches, which would provide the knowledge required by girls in search
of remunerative employment. This effort shows the spirit of practical
benevolence which animates the Limeña in her charitable work. It is a
long step toward relieving the pressure of modern needs when a race,
whose women have been so closely guarded as have those of Spanish
ancestry, can throw off the prejudices of traditional custom and meet a
present demand with a present remedy. The adverse fortunes of war in the
southern part of the United States forced many gently born women to
enter the business world. At first they stayed at home and earned a
pittance bending over the embroidery frame, but modern machinery made
even this a hopeless effort in the face of too strong competition, and
they turned their attention to more lucrative posts. While war continues
to destroy the natural breadwinners of society and to deplete the home
treasury, it is useless to preach about “woman’s sphere.”

[Illustration: MAIN CORRIDOR OF THE NATIONAL CLUB, LIMA.]

While the descendants of the Spaniards in Peru have been the directing
power in the affairs of the republic, as they were in the viceroyalty,
yet the _mestizo_ and the Indian have not remained ciphers in the social
development of the nation. The descendants of the Inca princes were
educated in colonial days in colleges especially established for that
purpose, and under the republic all classes of Indians have received the
benefits of instruction; but it is not to be expected that the
descendants of the Inca’s humble subjects can show the same degree of
progress as those whose ancestors were of the family of Manco-Ccapac,
and had the mental training of royal princes for long generations. The
latter are intelligent, very proud, and have shown themselves worthy of
the white man’s admiration on many occasions. General Andrés Santa Cruz
was of the Inca’s race, as were many others who contributed to the
triumph of republican principles in the great war of independence. In
the _sierra_, many families of Inca descent, whose sons have filled
posts of importance in the republic, have comfortable homes and broad
acres rich in harvests. The race, as a whole, however, shows no more
initiative to-day than at the time of the conquest; under the present
government, the Indian is generally contented and obedient, peacefully
cultivating the fields as he did under the Inca’s rule. His songs,
called _tristes_ by his Spanish compatriots, are most melancholy and
seem to express the sadness of ages. Indeed, the Indian himself looks
like a survival of antiquity, out of place in a modern world. The
_mestizos_ are apparently a much happier people than the Indians; they
are good artisans and are successful in trade. They attend faithfully to
religious duties, and throng the processions of the Virgin, and other
feasts in celebration of the saints. These processions take place in
every city and town of the republic, and though they have lost much of
the sumptuous magnificence that characterized all religious festivals
under the viceroyalty, they are still conducted with great ceremony.

[Illustration: ANNUAL PROCESSION IN HONOR OF SAINT ROSE OF LIMA.]

Both the religious and the educational institutions of the country have
contributed to impress on the social culture of the Peruvians a distinct
individuality; added to these influences, within recent years an
independent factor has been introduced, in the form of clubs and
societies of a literary and scientific character, which encourage the
development of independent thought among the people. Associations of
professional men meet to discuss the latest discoveries in the science
with which their labor is identified, and delegates are sent to the
principal gatherings of a scientific character which are held annually
in all parts of the world. The artisans also have their clubs and take
an increasing interest in the progress of industrial labor in their own
and other countries. In some of these clubs classes are held for the
purpose of education.

In order to know and appreciate the social life of a nation it is
necessary to become acquainted with its various public institutions, not
only the clubs and societies that represent the ambitions of a few
intellectual citizens, but its libraries and schools, the productions in
literature and art effected by its people, and the popular sentiment as
interpreted through the press. In the literature and the art of a nation
are expressed its deepest feeling and highest aspirations.

                              CHAPTER XIV
  THE NATIONAL LIBRARY—PERUVIAN WRITERS—PAINTING AND ILLUSTRATIVE ART


[Illustration: DR. RICARDO PALMA. DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY,
LIMA.]

In accordance with the liberal principles of an independent nation, one
of the first acts of the government, after the inauguration of the
republic, was to issue a decree on the 28th of April, 1821, creating the
National Library. Freedom of the press was established at the same time,
and other measures were adopted by which the newly emancipated people
could enjoy opportunities for gaining knowledge that had not been
available under colonial rule. The Liberator, General San Martin,
realizing the importance of providing every means for the better
education of the masses, took advantage of the first occasion that
presented itself to forward his liberal plans. Not only was public
instruction established on a broad basis, but the spirit of inquiry was
stimulated by encouraging the publication of reading matter, and by
giving literature a permanent place among the national institutions.
Formerly, the means of gaining information had been very limited, in
consequence of the strict rules which governed the distribution of
books.

The patriotic motive that guided the Liberator in founding the National
Library is evident in his decree, which declares that “as ignorance is
the strongest pillar of despotism, free governments should adopt an
opposite course, allowing mankind to follow its natural impulse toward
perfection.” The library was first opened to the public on the 17th of
September, 1822, with a collection of about twelve thousand volumes.
Many of these were of great value, as the long residence of Spanish
state and church officials in the viceregal capital had resulted in the
introduction of the best European literature, some of which, interdicted
by the Holy Office, had been concealed for a long time, and came to
light only with the triumph of the Independence. All the works printed
by the press in Peru since its first establishment in 1580 were placed
in the National Library, which was enriched with rare editions of the
Bible; a curious volume on palmistry, dated 1449, presented by General
San Martin; a breviary, printed in Venice in 1489; and an edition of
Plato of still older publication, as well as complete sets of the
writings of classic and modern philosophers and scientists. The nucleus
was chiefly derived from the convents, which had been the great
repositories of literature in colonial days, and many Latin books, in
folio, were acquired, treating chiefly of religious subjects. The
library was established in a building formerly occupied by the College
of Caciques, famous under the viceroyalty as an institution that
provided for the Christian education of noble descendants of the Inca
emperors.

When the Chilean army occupied Lima in 1881, this flourishing
institution, which was among the most important in America, was
destroyed, the valuable collection, then amounting to about fifty
thousand volumes, being in part carried off to Chile and the remainder
publicly sold at auction by weight.

The restoration of the National Library is largely due to the efforts of
its present director, Dr. Ricardo Palma, who worked with zeal and
enthusiasm to recover a treasure which he recognized as of priceless
value, since it represented not merely intrinsic worth but also the
standard of intellectual recreation which the public demanded after half
a century of free government. Dr. Palma repurchased some of the precious
volumes put up at auction, and secured rare old manuscripts that had
been sold as waste paper. The portraits of the viceroys, all of which
had been torn down from the walls of the library by the invading
soldiery, were recovered, with two or three exceptions. This collection
is one of the most notable in America, as the portraits are consecutive
examples of the art of three centuries, and provide a unique study for
the connoisseur. They have recently been removed to the National Museum.
The loss of the library was one which no effort could entirely replace,
and the Peruvian people regretted it as a bitter calamity; everything
possible was immediately done toward making a new collection. Other
nations expressed their regret and sympathy, and many gifts of valuable
works were received. Spain, Argentina, the United States, and Ecuador
sent generous collections of books, many patriotic Peruvians made
donations from their private possessions, and, in 1884, the National
Library reopened with twenty-eight thousand volumes.

At present the library consists of fifty thousand books and manuscripts,
arranged according to a systematic classification. The library building
occupies a central location, and is a typical Spanish edifice, built
around an open court, or _patio_, with upper and lower corridors, which
were originally the cloisters of the College of Caciques. The rooms used
by the National Library extend the full length of the building, and
include, in addition to the book section, a commodious reading-room,
furnished with modern desks and lighted with electricity; the library is
open to the public in the evenings as well as during the day. On the
bookshelves, a very important place is given to the collection sent by
the Smithsonian Institute, of Washington, amounting in all to five
thousand volumes. A recent acquisition, known as the Quixote collection,
embraces the most notable editions of Cervantes, among others that of
Argamasilla, which was printed with silver type, and one issued in
Argentina in 1905, the latter being the only edition published in South
America. This classic of old Spain has been translated into eighteen
different languages, and the Library of Lima has copies of all except
the Japanese, Turkish, Finnish, and Dutch editions. The library has also
been enriched by a gift, from President José Pardo, of sixty volumes,
the scientific collection of the celebrated ornithologist, William
Nation, purchased by His Excellency for the section of natural sciences.

[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, LIMA.]

Dr. Palma is one of the best known writers of South America, as well as
a devoted bibliophilist, and his knowledge of Spanish literature has
been gained through years of acquaintance with the best authors of Spain
and Spanish-America. In restoring the National Library, he has given
particular attention to the acquirement of noted works and rare
editions. With especial pride in the genius of his compatriot, Don Pablo
Olavide, whose literary productions had a tremendous influence in
stimulating liberal thought among the Spanish-Americans a hundred years
ago, Dr. Palma is now engaged in getting together a complete collection
of the eleven existing editions of that author’s _El Evangelio en
Triumfo_, the greater part of which he had already secured. Don Pablo
Olavide was a native of Lima, where he was born in 1725. When a young
man, he went to Europe, became an enthusiastic friend of Voltaire and an
admirer of the Encyclopædists, and was a special mark for the
surveillance of the Holy Office until his death in 1803. His books were
read with avidity by the youth of Peru and the other Spanish colonies,
and they may be said to have prepared the way for the patriotic movement
which later won the independence of Spanish-America.

During the last days of the viceroyalty the sentiment of freedom was the
predominating note in the national literature, and the stirring period
of the independence brought many gifted orators and writers into
prominence. In the columns of the _Mercurio Peruano_, politics and
poetry were themes that divided honors about equally, the style in which
a political essay was written in those days being hardly less flowery
than the language of verse. In this periodical also appeared articles on
philosophy, history, and science. Don Hipólito Unánue, of Arica, one of
the editors of the _Mercurio Peruano_, exerted a powerful influence in
favor of republicanism during the last years of colonial rule. He wrote
under the pseudonym of “Ariosto,” and, after the inauguration of the
republic, continued to contribute to the national literature, at the
same time taking an active part in the government as Minister of Finance
in the cabinet of President Riva-Agüero. Contemporary with Unánue,
Bernardo Alcedo, a noted writer and musician, fought in the war of
independence and celebrated the victory for the patriot cause by
composing the national hymn of Peru, the music of which is inspiring and
triumphant. Mariano Eduardo de Rivero, the author of _Antiguëdades
Peruanas_, José Gregorio Paredes, a celebrated astronomer and
mathematician, Mateo Aguilar, whose panegyric on Ignatius Loyola has
been translated into several languages, and Manuel Lorenzo Vidaurre, an
eminent jurist, the first president of the Supreme Court of Peru, were
among the celebrated writers who flourished during the early years of
the republic. Miguel Garaycochea, author of _Calculo Binomial_, was a
noted scientist of that time.

The literature of Peru reached a period of prolific expression about the
middle of the past century, when the inimitable satirists, Felipe Pardo
y Aliaga and Manuel Ascencio Segura wrote their comedies on the national
manners and customs. Felipe Pardo, the grandfather of President José
Pardo, was a statesman as well as a poet, and was representing his
government as minister to one of the European courts when he was made a
member of the Spanish Royal Academy. His best known work is called _El
Espejo de mi tierra_—“The mirror of my country,”—and gives an
entertaining picture of Peruvian life fifty years ago. Segura’s
comedies, written about the same time, were clever satires on the
prevailing creole customs, especially his _La Saya y Manto_, _Ña
Catita_, _El Resignado_, and _Lances de Amancaes_. Another writer of the
same period, Manuel Atanasio Fuentes, who satirized the political and
social foibles of his day in a periodical called _El Murcielago_—“The
Bat,”—found in literary work a pleasing diversion. He was a noted jurist
and wrote treatises on constitutional law, administration, and similar
subjects. The Peruvian critic is often satirical in his treatment of men
and books, a keen sense of humor giving piquancy to his judgment. In
this art, Don Pedro Paz Soldán y Unánue excelled, his pseudonym “Juan de
Arona” being known throughout South America. He was a member of the
Spanish Academy and a distinguished Latin and Greek scholar. In _El
Chispazo_, a humorous periodical which he edited, his crisp epigrammatic
style was at its best. He was born in Lima in 1839 and died in 1895,
having employed his talent ably and successfully through the difficult
periods when his country was facing the greatest crises that could arise
to impede the progress of a young nation.

[Illustration: PATIO OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, LIMA.]

Many of the intellectual leaders of Peru were nurtured under the
strenuous regimen which the unsettled conditions of the first thirty
years of republican rule made necessary, their genius shining out with
brilliancy during the period of peace and prosperity that followed. It
was not unusual to find a general of the army, whose war record was the
pride of his country, devoting himself to literary work later, when
quiet reigned. One of the most celebrated historians of Peru, Don Manuel
Mendiburu, whose monumental work, _Diccionario Biográfico del Peru_ has
made his name immortal, fought in the patriot ranks during the war of
independence, was made Minister of War by President Gamarra, became a
general of the army, and was president of the commission that reformed
the military laws, as they exist to-day. He was a statesman as well as a
soldier, and presided over the assembly which, in 1860, promulgated the
present constitution of Peru. As Minister of War, Minister of Finance,
and Diplomatic Minister to England, he served his country with honor and
distinction, being one of the most illustrious men of his day, in war
and peace. It was only in the intervals of his public career that Dr.
Mendiburu found time to pursue his biographical studies, the results of
which are most important to Peruvian literature. For, though this great
work is called a dictionary, its sixteen volumes are so complete in
historical information as to be entitled to rank among the best records
of the colonial period of Peru. Of the eighty years that covered the
lifetime of this great man, from 1805 to 1885, more than three score
were spent in public service. He led the vanguard in the last war, was
War Minister in 1880, and at the time of his death was president of a
commission charged with the reorganization of the National Archives. It
is not often that human activity extends over so many years, and one is
accustomed to think that in Latin countries, and especially in the
tropics, the spirit of youth is of short duration, the precocious child
arriving early at the zenith of his possibilities, and declining at an
age when the slower native of a less favored zone is in his prime. There
are remarkable exceptions to this rule in Peru, where the years have
passed lightly over many a _viejo verde_, as the “green old age” is
called. Don Francisco de Paula Vigil, the liberal philosopher of Tacna,
prominent for half a century in politics and literature and director of
the National Library for forty years, died in 1875 at eighty-three years
of age. Luciano Cisneros, an eminent orator, jurist, and writer on
constitutional law, was a member of the Academy of Jurisprudence in
Madrid, a judge of the Superior Court, Minister of State, Diplomatic
Representative of his government in Europe, and held his own among the
leading statesmen of Peru until his death in 1906, at seventy-four years
of age. Francisco Garcia Calderon, a member of the Spanish Academy and a
writer of note on legal and other subjects, as well as a statesman of
renown, was one of the most active leaders in promoting his country’s
progress at the time of his death, in 1905, though he had already passed
his seventieth year. The present director of the National Library,
though still one of the younger generation in spirit and sympathy,
published his first book, _Anales de la Inquisicion de Lima_, forty-five
years ago, and was at that time already prominent in political affairs.
As consul to Brazil, secretary to President Balta, and Senator of the
republic in three legislatures, he early proved himself one of the most
brilliant young men of the nation, and when he went abroad in 1865 after
leaving Brazil, his genius shone with lustre in the highest intellectual
circles of Europe. The fame of Ricardo Palma rests chiefly on his
masterpiece, _Tradiciones Peruanas_, the only literature in existence
which gives local color to the history of the viceroyalty in Peru, and
preserves for posterity the very life and essence of its fascinating
social annals. The Lima of the _Tradiciones_ has survived the change of
government and, though one no longer sees the viceroy and his court, it
is still possible to visit many places made familiar by Dr. Palma’s
stories. The charming Limeña does not now appear in _saya y manto_, it
is true, but she is as clever and bright as of old; the Franciscan friar
is still in evidence, and the little _zambo_ wears the same contented
countenance that distinguished his ancestors a hundred years ago; the
Indian is sad and patient, as the author of _Tradiciones_ paints him.
The characters that live and move in Ricardo Palma’s book are real and
immortal. Up to the present time no other author in America has been
able to paint such vivid and intimate pictures of colonial times. The
work was originally published in six volumes, in 1870, though many
editions have since appeared, and a new volume has recently been added,
entitled _Ultimas Tradiciones Peruanas_. Ricardo Palma is a member of
the Royal Spanish Academy, the Hispanic Society of America, and other
leading historical and scientific societies of Europe and America. The
author of the present work has just completed the translation of
_Tradiciones Peruanas_ into English.

If the more intimate features of colonial society are to be understood
only through a perusal of _Tradiciones Peruanas_, a general idea of the
viceroyalty is best obtained from the works of Don Sebastian Lorente,
who wrote the first complete history of Peru, in five volumes, published
in 1871, giving an especially interesting description of the colonial
period. He made a lifelong study of the history of the country, and for
forty years lectured on his favorite theme in the University of San
Marcos. Another historian, Don Mariano Paz Soldán, contributed a most
important geographical work to the literature descriptive of his
country, and wrote several books on historical subjects. His _Atlas del
Peru_ and _Diccionario Geografico y Estadistico_, published thirty years
ago, contained the first complete description of the political divisions
of the republic, and afforded valuable information regarding the
physical features, climate, resources, and population of Peru. Dr. Paz
Soldán was a statesman of noted ability and rendered invaluable services
to the cause of education and in behalf of prison reform. As Minister of
Justice and Public Instruction in the cabinet of President Balta, he
founded a school of sciences and reorganized the Universities of
Arequipa and Cuzco, besides establishing numerous secondary schools. The
illustrious patriot died in 1886 at sixty-five years of age, his funeral
being conducted with State ceremonies, and attended by the highest
officials of the government. The historian, Dr. Eugenio Larrabure y
Unánue, pronounced the funeral oration, and the assemblage at the bier
of the lamented scholar was representative of the best intellect of
Peru. Dr. Larrabure y Unánue is the author of a number of historical
works, of which his studies relating to ancient Peru possess especial
interest and value. He is also a statesman and diplomatist, literature
being his favorite diversion in such hours of leisure as an active
public career affords. Another celebrated Peruvian authority on the
antiquities of the country, Dr. Pablo Patron, is a scholar of
international renown, whose archæological study, _La Lluvia_, read a few
years ago before the Congress of Americanists at Stuttgart, attracted
general attention among antiquarians. Dr. Patron has rendered important
services to his country in scientific research and has made the study of
Peruvian textiles and potteries a specialty, giving them a fascinating
charm, which ethnologists as well as lovers of decorative art are quick
to appreciate.

[Illustration: DR. JOSÉ ANTONIO MIRÓ QUESADA, THE NESTOR OF THE PERUVIAN
PRESS.]

Several students of the literature of the Incas have devoted themselves
to the task of preserving Incaic legends and musical compositions. The
drama _Ollanta_ has been translated into Spanish by three well-known
scholars, Don José Sebastian Barranca, Dr. José Fernando Nadal, and Dr.
Gavino Pacheco Zegarra. Don José Maria Valleriestra, a musical composer
of note, is the author of two operas, _Ollanta_ and _Atahuallpa_, which
have been presented in Lima and elsewhere with success. The greatest
Peruvian writer on the subject of Incaic civilization and history—the
most celebrated chronicler of his people—was the Inca Garcilaso de la
Vega, who was born in Cuzco in 1539, and died in Spain in 1618. He spent
the first twenty-one years of his life in Peru, his father Garcilaso,
one of Pizarro’s followers, having married a native princess of the
royal line of Incas. His _Comentarios Reales_ are still regarded as the
most authentic source of information existing in reference to
prehistoric Peru.

The history of Peru, both ancient and modern, is a theme of such
extraordinary interest that it is not strange Peruvian writers should
have made it the predominating subject of their works. No country has
such a wealth of romance to kindle the imagination and to inspire the
poet, and no country has greater reason to be proud of its annals, and
the patriotic sentiment which finds expression in the literature and art
of the country is altogether admirable. The Athenæum of Lima, the
Geographic Society, and the Historical Institute, all intellectual
organizations, were created for the purpose of promoting the study of
Peru, from a literary, geographical, and historical standpoint, and
their libraries contain many valuable works by Peruvian as well as
foreign writers. The first of these institutions was founded under the
name of the Literary Club of Lima, in 1877, Don Francisco Garcia
Calderon being its president. Ten years later it was reorganized and
took the name of the Athenæum of Lima; among its members are the most
illustrious scholars of Peru. Don Luis B. Cisneros, a member of the
Spanish Royal Academy and one of Peru’s greatest poets was crowned by
the Athenæum, with impressive ceremonies, in 1897. His poems, novels,
and dramas are among the literary treasures of his country, and his
death, which occurred in 1903, was an occasion of national mourning. The
Athenæum was founded too late to number on its roll the gifted poets
Clemente Althaus, Nicolas Corpancho, Constantino Carrasco, Arnaldo
Marquez, Trinidad Fernandez, and Adolfo Garcia, who died several years
earlier; Carlos Augustus Salaverry, the son of the illustrious General
Felipe Santiago Salaverry, and a poet of great genius, died in Paris in
1888, a year after the Athenæum was organized; and José Antonio de la
Lavalle, a member of the Spanish Academy and a diplomatist of notable
talent, whose literary style was especially distinguished for its grace
and purity, reached the close of his useful and brilliant career in
1894, at sixty years of age. Don Felix Cipriano Coronel Zegarra, of the
Spanish Royal Academy, one of the most illustrious scholars of Peru and
a member of the Athenæum, collected a great deal of valuable information
relating to the literature of his country, and his _Notes for a Literary
History of Peru_, now in possession of the Faculty of Letters of the
University, contains sufficient material for a literary encyclopædia.

[Illustration: COLUMBUS BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA. BY IGNACIO
MERINO.]

The present president of the Athenæum is Dr. Javier Prado y Ugarteche,
Dean of the Faculty of Letters of the University, a statesman and
diplomatist, as well as an author of distinction. His book on the
condition of Peru during the viceroyalty is one of the most interesting
studies in sociology written within recent years. Dr. Prado y Ugarteche
is a booklover of fine judgment, and he possesses one of the largest and
most valuable libraries in America. His brother, Dr. Mariano Prado y
Ugarteche, is also a statesman and a bibliophilist. He is the author of
important works on literature and Incaic history. As a member of the
Athenæum, and as vice-president of the Historical Institute, he has done
much to promote the success of both these organizations. Another
prominent member of the Athenæum, who is secretary of the Historical
Institute as well, Don José Toribio Polo, occupies a unique place among
Peruvian scholars as a bibliographer and a literary critic. He was
formerly Dr. Palma’s assistant in the directorate of the National
Library, and to his patient investigation of ancient documents is due
the elucidation of many facts in the past history of the country, his
thorough knowledge of Peruvian chronicles giving especial value to the
critical studies he has made of various historical works.

[Illustration: THE DISILLUSION OF THE ARTIST. BY DANIEL HERNANDEZ.]

The purposes of the Athenæum and the Historical Institute are closely
related, both aiming to encourage intellectual progress, and many
writers of prominence belong to both societies. The Athenæum has been
called upon to mourn the loss of some of its most distinguished members
within the past few years, among them Don Carlos German Amezaga, a poet
of rare genius and culture, who was its vice-president at the time of
his death, in 1907. He belonged to a family of noted talent, his father,
Don Mariano Amezaga, having been a philosopher and writer of great
ability. The secretary of the Athenæum, Don Francisco Garcia Calderon y
Rey, and the assistant secretary, Don José de la Riva-Agüero y Osma,
also inherit their literary genius, their surnames indicating their
distinguished descent. Don José Santos Chocano has attained an honored
place among the literary lights of Europe, and the Athenæum is justly
proud of his success. Don Luis Fernan Cisneros, Don Teobaldo Elias
Corpancho, Don Carlos Larrabure y Correa, Don Clemente Palma, Don
Aurelio Arnao, and Don José Augusto de Izcué are among the poets whose
verses are a credit to the Athenæum. Don José Izcué writes history as
well as poetry. As Director-general of Public Instruction in the
_ministerio_ of Dr. Jorge Polar, he was identified with the inauguration
of the Historical Institute, and especially with the establishment of
the museum, being appointed director of the department devoted to the
colonial and republican collection. His historical works are chiefly
studies of the republican period.

In the _Revista Historica_ and the quarterly review of the Geographic
Society, the representative scientific periodicals of Lima, and in
_Prisma_, _Actualidades_, _Variedades_ and other illustrated weeklies of
superior literary and artistic merit, the best intellect of Peru has
found expression. Don Carlos Romero, the editor of the _Revista
Historica_, Don Clemente Palma, editor of _Variedades_ and Don Enrique
Castilla, editor of _Actualidades_, are writers of exceptional talent
and originality. Periodical literature is a popular avenue for the
literary aspirant, and the number of writers increases as the magazines,
reviews, humorous weeklies, and daily newspapers multiply. The directors
of all these publications are writers of note, and it is frequently
through their initiative that societies are formed for the promotion of
science or literature. The founder of the Geographic Society, Don Luis
Carranza, a native of Ayacucho and one of the most distinguished writers
of Peru, was at one time a director of _El Comercio_, the oldest daily
newspaper in Peru. He was the author of important historical works and
his influence was great in stimulating intellectual progress. Few
institutions in South America are better known abroad than the Lima
Geographic Society, which was founded in 1888 and installed in its
present quarters in 1891. As the title signifies, the principal purpose
of the Society is to foster geographical study in Peru, though its scope
is broad and liberal, and the quarterly review not only contains
articles on archæological geography, statistics, and climatology but
also the texts of conferences given in the hall of the society on
scientific topics of general interest. The society is a dependency of
the Foreign Office and is under the protection of the government. Dr.
Eulogio Delgado, the president, is a recognized authority on the
geography of Peru, and under his administration the society has achieved
its present importance and prestige. The secretory, Dr. Scipion Llona,
has made interesting studies in archæological geography and Incaic
history, and the sub-secretary, Don Carlos Bachman, is the author of the
best existing history of the political demarcation of Peru. On the
membership roll, which contains three hundred and thirty-five names of
active members, in addition to honorary and corresponding associates,
are some of the most illustrious scholars of Peru, and the library of
the society is constantly enriched by the acquisition of valuable works.
Don Alejandro Garland, a prominent member of the Geographic Society,
recently published an important book on his country, _Peru in 1906_,
and, from time to time, articles, pamphlets, and larger volumes are
issued by the society or its members, which add to historic and
descriptive literature.

The progress of the press in Peru has been most notable during the past
few years. _El Comercio_, which has been a faithful chronicler of the
political and social events of the country for nearly three-quarters of
a century, still stands at the head as a representative of Peruvian
journalistic ethics and enterprise. The same policy which made the paper
the exponent of liberty half a century ago,—when it fought a noble
campaign in favor of the abolition of slavery, first of the negroes and
later of the Indians,—makes it to-day the leader in promoting the
highest principles of humanity, advocating the most necessary reforms,
and encouraging the best citizenship. Modern methods are employed in its
extensive news service and the latest material improvements have been
inaugurated in every department. The proprietor and editor-in-chief of
_El Comercio_, Don José Antonio Miró Quesada, is the Nestor of
journalism in Peru and is esteemed as the exponent of its most worthy
ideals. The press of the republic is represented by about two hundred
newspapers, the principal dailies being _El Comercio_, _El Diario_, and
_La Prensa_ of Lima; _La Bolsa_ and _El Deber_ of Arequipa; _El
Comercio_ and _El Sol_ of Cuzco; _La Razón_ and _La Industria_ of
Trujillo; though every city and town has its newspaper, and in the
larger centres an illustrated weekly is also issued. Many of the leading
editors and journalists are prominent in politics and hold important
offices in the government. Dr. Felix Castro, the owner and editor of _El
Comercio_, in Cuzco, was secretary of the presidency in the
administration of President Serapio Calderon and served his country as
propagandist in the United States, where his journalistic talents were
of great value in advancing his mission through the _New York Herald_,
_Sun_, and other dailies.

In painting and music, as well as in literature, Peru has an honored
place among American nations, though it is generally the fashion in
Peru, as in the United States, to maintain that only in Europe are great
masterpieces painted, and that home talent cannot achieve the results
possible in the “atmosphere” of the art centres of Paris, London, and
Rome. Many of Peru’s greatest artists have their permanent place of
residence abroad, and in the art exhibitions, their names appear among
those of the most successful painters. This was true half a century ago,
when one of the greatest painters of his day was a Peruvian, Don Ignacio
Merino, born in Piura and sent to Paris to study art under Monvoisin and
Delacroix. In the years 1869 and 1870 he won the highest honors of the
Salon, his famous work, _Columbus before the University of Salamanca_,
being among the noted modern masterpieces. _The Vengeance of Cornaro_,
_Felipe II. Dying_, _The Friar Painter_, and _Cervantes Reading Quixote_
are well known to connoisseurs and possess superior merit. The
illustrious painter died in Paris and was buried in Père la Chaise. He
bequeathed his paintings to the city of Lima and they are now in the
gallery of the Historical Museum. In the museum also hangs the
masterpiece of Luis Montero, another Piura artist, who was educated in
Italy and studied under Fortuny. It is entitled _The Funeral of
Atahuallpa_ and is notable for the contrasts of stillness and movement,
though the Indians are too dark in color and the women too European in
type to give a faithful idea of the subject. In the gallery of the
museum are historical paintings by Francisco Esteban de Ingunza and
other noted Peruvian artists.

Don Luis Bacaflor is esteemed one of the greatest Peruvian painters of
the present day. His _Head of an Old Man_ is a celebrated study painted
by him several years ago, and he is the author of many other well known
pictures. His home is in Paris, where he counts among his friends the
leading artists of Europe. The story of Bacaflor’s early struggles and
his sturdy patriotism give a peculiar interest to his later successes.
When a mere youth, he went to Chile to study his beloved art, giving
evidences of the genius which has since developed in all its strength.
He won the Prix de Rome, in recognition of which the Chilean government
offered to send the aspiring young painter to Europe, that he might have
the advantage of the best training of foreign masters. With what a
thrill of delight must the student have seen such a prospect open before
him! But,—it was impossible to accept the terms, which demanded that he
renounce his beloved Peru and become a Chilean citizen. Not a moment did
the patriotic young artist hesitate, sending at once the answer which
was apparently to cut him off from a brilliant career and the
achievement of his dearest ambition. His reward has been a noble one.
The Peruvian government in recognition of its gifted and patriotic young
citizen, sent him to study under its own auspices, and the result has
been an honor to the nation. Albert Lynch, also a Peruvian, a native of
Trujillo, is among the famous painters at the French capital. Francisco
Lazo, Daniel Hernandez, of Huancavelica, Herminio Arias, the Countess de
Beon, Alberto Pareja de Mijares, and Juan Lepiani are names well known
in the art circles of Europe, especially in Rome and Paris, where their
pictures have been exhibited in the salons. Abelardo Alvarez Calderon,
who has won fame as an illustrator, lives in London. There are still a
few artists who have remained in their own country, and the illustrative
art, as seen in the magazines, gives evidence of superior talent. Don
Miguel Miró Quesada is one of the most gifted of the younger generation,
his clever sketches and caricatures being an attractive feature of the
current periodicals.

The painter, Francisco Lazo, was both litterateur and artist, and the
author of the Peruvian national hymn, Bernardo Alcedo, wrote a book on
the elemental philosophy of music, besides composing the music of the
hymn and a number of masses, a _Miserere_, and other works. The composer
Valleriestra, devotes all his leisure to musical study. Peru has a
celebrated cantatrice, Señorita Margarita Alvarez de Rocáfuerte, who has
won fame in the European capitals by her divine voice and the sympathy
and grace with which she interprets the masters of music. She is young,
beautiful, and of artistic temperament, and wins her audience from the
first moment. Not long ago, this charming songbird of the Andes received
the gold medal in a musical contest in the Royal Academy of London.

The Philharmonic Societies of Lima and Arequipa are flourishing
organizations, whose purpose is the encouragement of musical art. The
Arequipa society is older and of larger membership than the Philharmonic
of the capital, which was inaugurated less than a year ago. The Lima
society is composed of patrons and active members, the former
contributing funds for the maintenance of the society, while the latter
assist in classes and take part in the musical concerts that are given
under its direction.

                               CHAPTER XV
        THE OLDEST UNIVERSITY IN AMERICA—MODERN SCHOOLS OF PERU


[Illustration: DR. LUIS F. VILLARÁN, RECTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN
MARCOS.]

Founded in 1551, nearly a hundred years before Harvard received its
charter, the University of San Marcos is the oldest educational
institution of America. Under the royal seal of the Emperor Charles V.
and Queen Joana, his mother, it was established in the City of the Kings
soon after the inauguration of the viceroyalty, and was conceded all the
honors and privileges enjoyed by the University of Salamanca, at that
time the most celebrated seat of learning in Europe. The royal grant was
issued to the priors of the Dominican order, and the original lecture
halls were installed in the chief monastery of “Santo Domingo,” in Lima.
Twenty years later, King Philip II. ordered the secularization of the
university and its separation from the Dominican convent. The cathedral
was then chosen as the hall for literary functions, and in one of its
chapels, consecrated to the Virgin known as _La Antigua_, and especially
venerated from that time by the university, the degrees of scholarship
were conferred. This chapel is of especial interest because of its
history, some of the most impressive ceremonies of the viceregal period
having taken place here. The conferring of degrees in the early history
of the university was attended with elaborate religious formalities, an
important feature being the celebration of a mass of the Holy Ghost in
preparation for the event. After this solemn sacrament, the candidate
passed through two days’ examination, chiefly of a religious character.
If successful, he was then led to the chapel of the Virgin, accompanied
by his fellow-students and the doctors of the faculties, and was obliged
to make the customary profession of faith, the same as that adopted by
the University of Paris in the beginning of the sixteenth century, which
required the candidate to pledge his loyalty to the mystery of the
Immaculate Conception. The degree of doctor was then conferred by the
dean, who represented both the royal and the pontifical authority; and
as soon as this part of the ceremony was concluded the sponsor decorated
the new doctor with the insignia of his class.

In 1572, Don Gaspar Meneses, a scholar of note, who held the degrees of
Doctor of Medicine and Master of Arts, was appointed the first rector of
the university. He was well fitted, by his piety and learning, to
promote the education of the colony in accordance with the ideals that
prevailed during that early period. The independent career of the
University of San Marcos began in 1574, the name being chosen by lot
from a list of saints’ appellatives; and on the 31st of December of that
year the first reunion was celebrated in a building purchased by the
faculty. Two years later, during the reign of the Viceroy Toledo, an
edifice was constructed for the university, in the Plaza de la
Constitucion, which was occupied by its classes until 1770, when, after
the expulsion of the Jesuits, the committee charged with the final
distribution of their schools made the college of San Carlos the
university building, promoting the two flourishing Jesuit schools of San
Carlos and, later, San Felipe, to equal dignity and privileges with the
classes of San Marcos. The college of La Libertad was accorded the same
advancement in 1826. La Libertad was a college for Indian princes, and
had been called Del Principe during the viceroyalty. An interesting
chronicler of those days gives a charming description of the collegians
of San Carlos, Del Principe, Santo Toribio, and other schools. The
students of San Carlos were distinguished by their black dress, cocked
hats, and dress swords; the young caciques of Del Principe wore a full
suit of green with a crimson shoulder ribbon and a cocked hat; and the
Santo Toribio collegians adopted the almond-colored _opa_, a gown made
like a poncho, wide at the bottom, with which a pale blue scarf was
worn, and a square bonnet of black cloth.

[Illustration: CLOISTER OF THE NATIONAL COLLEGE OF GUADALUPE, LIMA.]

The curriculum of a university in the sixteenth century was governed by
the predominating influence in intellectual culture, as it is to-day. In
Spain, even more than in other countries of Europe, this influence was
essentially religious in character. Theology was the most important
branch of study, and law and medicine were taught from textbooks which
read more like religious treatises than scientific compendiums of
knowledge. In the University of Lima, the plan of studies included three
classes daily in theology, three in law, two in canonical law, two in
medicine, two in grammar, and one in native languages, the last being
considered necessary for the propagation of the faith among the Indians.
During the viceroyalty, the University of San Marcos was an exclusively
aristocratic institution, and its chief mission was to educate the
nobility and the clergy, the latter ranking in the same class as the
highest aristocracy. The candidate for a degree had to meet such
enormous expenses that its advantages were within the reach of only a
favored few. He was obliged to give a sum of money to each doctor of his
faculty and to those of all the other faculties, a larger sum to the
rector and further amounts to the dean of his faculty, the sponsors in
the ceremony, and other ministering officials. If a layman, he was
expected to present his fellow-graduates with a silk cap, the biretta
taking its place in the case of a sacerdote. “Four pounds of food and
six hens” are named as the gifts which each colleague must receive from
the new doctor. These expenses amounted to large sums in the aggregate,
and were greatly increased by the cost of the festivities with which
such an event was celebrated. It was the custom for the graduate to give
a bull fight in the _plaza_, always a costly entertainment; and he must
have a sumptuous dinner, at which his friends would toast the successful
scholar and felicitate him in poetical periods and oratorical flights.
The most modest cost never went below ten thousand dollars in an epoch
when that sum meant many times the wealth it does to-day; and stories
are related of brilliant festivities in which the reckless scions of
wealthy noble houses spent sums that call to mind the follies of
millionaire spendthrifts of the present time. Toward the middle of the
eighteenth century a resolution was passed by the directors, limiting
the expense to a deposit of two thousand dollars in the treasury of the
university, which freed the graduate from further responsibilities. This
resolution continued in force until 1870, when the sum was reduced to
eight hundred dollars; subsequent reductions have brought it down to the
present cost, which is fifty _soles_ for the bachelor’s degree and one
hundred _soles_ for that of doctor. Students who have excelled in their
classes, and have taken the highest prizes, called _contentas_, are
exempt from the payment of any dues. The purpose of the _contenta_ is to
enable young men of energy and ambition, but with small means, to profit
by the advantages of a liberal education. The Faculty of Letters gives
free scholarships to its most successful students and exempts from the
payment of dues all who have obtained a prize in any course of study.

[Illustration: DR. MANUEL BARRIOS, DEAN OF THE FACULTY OF MEDICINE,
LIMA.]

The University of San Marcos is to-day a thoroughly modern institution,
representative of the liberal spirit of progress which pervades all
classes in Peru,—a country that has passed through greater and more
vital changes than fall to the lot of most nations. What transformations
have been wrought in education in Peru since the _amauttas_ imparted
knowledge to the sons of the Sun, holding its precious truths too sacred
to be communicated to any but noble princes! The attitude of the Spanish
teachers was less openly restrictive, though, in effect, the system of
education was little broader than it had been under the monarchs of
Cuzco. The lessons of the temple were replaced by those of the convent,
and the benefits of knowledge were still chiefly confined to the
nobility. With the evolution of ideas that modern civilization
encouraged, conditions gradually improved during nearly three hundred
years of Spanish rule, and the eighteenth century witnessed the
phenomenon of independent thought, the awakening of the individual in
society. With the inauguration of the republic, the progress of Peru
entered a new channel, and though, at first, the stream of liberal ideas
had to force a narrow passage between walls of tradition, to surmount
rocks and boulders of obstructing prejudice, carrying in its flow an
accumulated driftwood of sentiment from the ancient groves of worship,
yet its course has been always toward the sea of universal good, and its
channel, deepened and widened by the growing force of the current, now
forms the bed of a mighty tide of worthy endeavor.

The university leads in promoting the interests of a broad and liberal
education in Peru, and, under the present administration, important
reforms have been introduced, in accord with the progressive ideals of
the twentieth century. The government of the university is in the hands
of a council, composed of the rector, vice-rector, and secretary of the
institution, with the dean and a delegate from each of the faculties. It
is practically independent in the conduct of its affairs, the state
having only the economic interest which rests on a pecuniary grant, and
even this is disposed of according to the discretion of the University
Council. Although all education in Peru is under the immediate
protection and solicitude of the supreme government, the intervention of
the executive is used only for the improvement of educational advantages
and the extension of public instruction. In all that relates to the
internal régime of the university, the rector and his advisers
constitute the supreme authority. Dr. Don Luis F. Villarán succeeded the
lamented Dr. Francisco Garcia Calderon as head of the university in
1905, and has continued the progressive methods of that learned
statesman. The past three years have been marked by several important
reforms.

The closing ceremonies of the university year of 1907 took place March
15, 1908, instead of the 24th of December, 1907, in consequence of the
students having been called away in November for military manœuvres,
obedient to the new law of forced military service. The occasion was one
of solemn ceremony, President Pardo attending, with his cabinet. The
address of the rector included a résumé of the year’s events in the
university, showing that its influence and usefulness had been
increased, and notable advancement made in its affairs. The prestige of
the university was enhanced last year through the brilliant record of
its delegates at the congress of students in Montevideo, when this
institution was shown to be in the first rank among Spanish-American
institutions in culture and progress.

[Illustration: THE FACULTY OF MEDICINE, LIMA.]

The curriculum of studies is under the direction of six faculties:
Jurisprudence, which confers the degree of lawyers and ministers on the
completion of a five years’ course, the dean of the faculty being Dr.
Lizardo Alzamora; Medicine, granting the title of “Physician and
Surgeon” to graduates who complete its six years’ course, Dr. Manuel
Barrios, a statesman of distinction, now president of the Senate, being
dean of this faculty; and the Faculties of Theology, Mathematics and
Physical and Natural Sciences, Philosophy, Letters and Administrative
and Political Economy, which do not confer professional degrees. In
order to be eligible to the Faculty of Medicine, the student must have
completed two years of the course in Natural Science and the obligatory
course of the first and second years of Mathematical Science and
Physics. The Faculty of Letters, presided over by the dean, Dr. Javier
Prado y Ugarteche, renders especial services and performs double duty by
preparing students to follow the career of the law and training
professors to teach in the higher public schools and colleges. It is
thus the meeting ground between the university and the primary school,
its graduates being afterward represented both in the highest classes of
the Faculty of Jurisprudence and among superintendents of primary
schools. Only recently a law was introduced in the Senate through the
efforts of university professors, to establish complementary courses in
the Faculties of Letters and Sciences for the special training of
professors to direct the national colleges of secondary instruction. The
law makes professorship a public career sufficiently attractive to
induce students of ability to devote themselves exclusively to this
pursuit. A four years’ term of preparation is required, practical
teaching in the College of Guadalupe being included in the last two
years’ course.

[Illustration: DR. JAVIER PRADO Y UGARTECHE, DEAN OF THE LITERARY
FACULTY, UNIVERSITY OF SAN MARCOS.]

The Faculty of Administrative and Political Economy, which, as elsewhere
stated, was founded by President Manuel Pardo, was first organized by
the eminent scholar, Dr. Pradier Fodéré. The object of this faculty is
to give special instruction to those who are preparing to follow a
diplomatic career or to direct administrative offices. The degree of
doctor is conferred after a three years’ course in constitutional,
international, administrative, diplomatic and maritime law, political
economy, economical legislation of Peru, science of finance, financial
legislation of Peru, and statistics. The present dean of the faculty is
Dr. Ramón Ribeyro, a noted authority on international affairs and a
member of the supreme court of justice. The Faculty of Theology gives a
theological education, the course covering six years. In the Faculty of
Sciences, the student is allowed to enter the School of Engineers after
completing the obligatory courses of the first and second years of
mathematical sciences and physics. The University of Lima is destined to
achieve greater distinction during the present century through its
liberal and democratic ideals than was gained in the three centuries of
existence under the influence of aristocratic exclusiveness. The new
edifice of the Faculty of Medicine is one of the signs of material
progress evident in many features of the institution. A _University
Review_ is published monthly, replacing the annual volume founded in
1862 as the Annals of the University. Although the ancient University of
San Marcos stands at the head of the educational institutions of Peru,
the universities of Arequipa, Cuzco, and Trujillo are important centres
of learning, having Faculties of Jurisprudence, Literature, and
Political and Natural Sciences. The rector of the University of
Arequipa, Dr. Jorge Polar, was Minister of Public Instruction during the
first two years of President Pardo’s administration, and is an eminent
authority on educational matters. Dr. Eliseo Araujo, rector of Cuzco
University, is also a distinguished statesman as well as an experienced
educator. Trujillo University is under the direction of Dr. Pedro M.
Ureña, who succeeded Dr. Carlos Washburn as rector, when that statesman
was called to the cabinet of President Pardo.

[Illustration: THE NATIONAL SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE, LIMA.]

The universities, which represent the most revered traditions of
education and reflect the highest culture of the nation, are
supplemented by a number of colleges and schools of special instruction
for pupils who, after graduating from the primary and secondary schools,
do not enter on a university career, but prefer to prepare for the
military service, to secure technical training, or to obtain a practical
knowledge of engineering, agriculture, etc. The School of Military
Cadets at Chorillos, the Naval School-ships, the School of Civil
Engineers, and the National School of Agriculture, as well as the
flourishing Technical School of Arts and Trades, fulfil these purposes.
The School of Arts and Trades was reorganized September 24, 1905, under
the direction of Dr. Pedro Paulet. The school was founded forty years
ago, and reorganized in 1871, when its purpose was declared to be “the
training of honest and capable mechanics.” Although the excellent work
of this school was interrupted for some years in consequence of the
calamitous war of the Pacific, yet its benefits have been so general
that, to-day, the best mechanics on the plantations of the coast and in
the mining establishments of the sierra are graduates of its classes.
These schools are now to be found in all the cities of the republic.

The mining interests of Peru, as well as the peculiar conditions that
govern transportation across its snow-capped sierras and through its
cañons, make the study of engineering of paramount importance. The
School of Engineers, under the direction of an expert Polish engineer,
Mr. Eduardo Habich, has for its object the teaching of civil,
industrial, and electrical engineering, and mining. The extraordinary
industrial development which Peru has experienced within the past few
years made it necessary, in 1901, to include industrial engineering in
the course of studies, which originally comprised only two sections,
that of electrical engineering being added in 1903. Graduates of this
school are entitled to rank as mining, civil, and industrial engineers,
and electricians; land surveyors are also trained here. The average
attendance is about two hundred pupils. Training is given in both theory
and practice, the students making trips to the mines of Cerro de Pasco
and Yauli as well as to the factories, smelters, and electrical plants
of these establishments. The school has complete laboratories as well as
collections of specimens for the study of mineralogy, geology, and other
subjects related to the course. Agricultural training is furnished in a
school organized for the purpose and directed by Belgian professors. The
instruction afforded is technical and of the greatest practical value,
including all that pertains to the administration and cultivation of a
landed estate.

The greatest evidence of educational progress in Peru is afforded by the
report of the past school year, especially as regards primary
instruction. According to the new law of December 5, 1905, primary
instruction was taken out of the hands of the municipalities and made
subject to the central government, and a special fund for educational
purposes was created in such a manner that it is bound to go on
increasing with the growth of population and the development of wealth.
Attendance at school was not only made obligatory but absolutely
gratuitous, schoolbooks, paper, etc., being provided free of charge to
the pupil. The name of President José Pardo will go down to posterity
with that of his illustrious father, as the friend of the helpless and
the protector of the humble, inspired by the true patriotism which seeks
the ennoblement and aggrandizement of the State by raising to the
highest mental and moral standard every citizen, from the proletaire to
the plutocrat. The reform of 1875 sought to extend to the poorest class
the blessings of education. But the law was impeded in its beneficent
action by inadequate funds and lack of unity in purpose. So long as
public instruction remained under municipal government, its advantages
could not be uniform or satisfactory. Political changes, the fluctuation
of rents, and other causes contributed to make the support of municipal
schools unsettled and dependent. A new law, passed in 1901, improved
conditions by the creation of a central Directorate of Primary
Instruction; but the efforts of this body were handicapped because the
local Councils and Commissions acting under its authority represented
municipal interests conflicting with its purposes. Complete
centralization was the only way to secure the successful establishment
of the educational system on a basis that would ensure permanent and
increasing progress, and elevate the national standard of culture.

[Illustration: THE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND TRADES, LIMA.]

In his programme four years ago, President Pardo set his government the
noble task of raising the Indian out of his apathetic and ignorant
condition and making him an active and conscious factor in citizenship,
declaring this to be a necessity as urgent as the building of railways,
the establishment of a fixed currency, or any of the reforms that have
contributed to the prosperity of the country. To stimulate a sense of
individual responsibility and worthy ambition in a race that for
centuries has lived only to obey,—under the Incas, the Curaca; under the
Spaniards, the priest; under the republic, the provincial governors and
the proprietors of estates on which they are employed—is an undertaking
that calls for tremendous patience, tact, and courage. President Pardo
believes that no effort should be considered too great which will
accomplish this noble task.

[Illustration: THE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERS, LIMA.]

A few educated Indians, descendants of the Inca nobility, have aided the
government in its purpose by trying to teach their benighted people the
meaning of freedom and to instil in them an appreciation of personal
rights. Phoccohuanca, who bears the Christian name of Carlos Portilla, a
pure Indian of Puno, has proved himself a worthy descendant of the great
Manco-Ccapac by his ambition, energy, and loyalty to his race. His story
is not unlike that of other self-made men. A thirst for knowledge made
him leave his native town when a mere child to seek an education in the
capital. From town to town he trudged, working at anything that offered
him a chance to gain a few pennies out of which a little was always put
aside for the purchase of books and for tuition. He was intelligent,
hard-working, patient, and economical, and succeeded in getting together
the requisite funds for his education, which was often interrupted by
“hard times,” but was always kept in mind as the goal of his efforts.
Now, at twenty-two years of age, he holds a teacher’s certificate, with
recommendations from several well-known educators of Peru, testifying to
his “aptitude, morality, and diligence”; as a preceptor in the
correctional school for boys, in Lima, his work has been eminently
satisfactory. Another Indian is the editor and proprietor of a newspaper
called _El Indio_, which bears the subtitle of “Defender of the social
interests of the native race.”

The new law governing primary education has already produced remarkable
results. The number of schools has increased from one thousand four
hundred and twenty-five under the support of the municipalities in 1905
to two thousand five hundred at present under the control of the central
government; the staff of teachers that numbered one thousand six hundred
and fifty-seven before the change of educational administration now
comprises three thousand and twenty under state direction; and the
pupils’ roll has swelled from one hundred thousand to one hundred and
fifty thousand names since the adoption of the new system two years ago.
The educational fund has been so greatly increased that the government
has not only been enabled to add to the number of schools and teachers,
but also to improve salaries, to provide instruction for a greater
number of pupils, to build and repair school-houses, acquire new and
modern pedagogical materials, maintain normal institutes, including one
for the instruction of teachers in manual training, and send teachers to
the United States for normal school training.

The General Directorate of primary instruction has the management of all
the various sections into which the system is divided, including those
that relate to the teaching corps, school materials, statistics,
accounts, etc., as well as to Departmental and Provincial inspectors.
Under the new régime, the school extends a beneficent influence over all
society, giving to the poorest child such training as will best prepare
him for the struggle of life. The law provides for two grades of primary
instruction, the first being the elementary school, in which are taught
reading, writing, arithmetic, notions of geography and history in
general and as related to Peru, rudimentary anatomy and physiology of
the human body, the making of objects of common use, gymnastics, and,
especially, the essential notions of morality and civic duty. This
course covers two years, after which the pupil may enter the second
grade, taught in what are known as school groups, or scholastic centres,
where three years more are required to complete the primary education,
including the learning of a trade. Free night schools for workmen are
maintained by the Department of Fomento, and in addition to the public
schools there are many private institutions throughout the republic for
primary and secondary education.

The question of hygiene in the primary schools occupies the particular
attention of the government, and a congress was recently held for the
purpose of studying the best means of protecting the health of children,
with a view to improving the general condition of the race, and making
the rising generation robust and strong. In 1907, a system of sanitary
and hygienic inspection was adopted for the schools of primary
instruction, and the results, so far, have been most satisfactory.

Intermediate or secondary education has also received special attention
during the present administration, new colleges having been established
in several cities, in addition to commercial and industrial schools in
Iquitos and Yurimaguas. Twenty-five government colleges provide
secondary instruction, three of these being girls’ schools in Trujillo,
Ayacucho, and Cuzco. Belgian and German professors have been engaged by
the government to conduct the courses of study in the greater number of
these schools. In the national colleges the pupil receives a general
education, the law requiring four years’ study to complete this course.
The graduate is then prepared either to leave school with sufficient
knowledge to serve the ordinary purposes of a business career, or to
enter the Faculty of Letters and Sciences in the University.

In every department of national education, the spirit of a broad and
liberal government is to be seen, and even in the private schools and
the colleges supported by benevolent institutions the influence of
modern reform is general and unmistakable. The most notable tendency of
education in Peru to-day is toward an increase of knowledge among the
poorer classes. Under the traditional system of instruction, now passing
away, the distinctions of caste were fostered and strengthened, because
of the character and scope of the old-time school. The higher classes of
society received more instruction than they applied in the course of
their after lives, while the lower classes were neglected, or taught
only so much as tended to impress on them their inferiority and the
duties of submission. Under such a system it was inevitable that tyranny
should flourish, and that the rich and governing class should abuse
their power over the poor and ignorant. But with the patriotic ideas
which have grown up and which now stimulate both the governing and the
governed, the question of education has become one of the national
requirements, and its benefits are enjoyed by all classes. It means the
development of the middle class, which a great economist calls “the
bulwark of a nation.”

                              CHAPTER XVI
                    THE BENEVOLENT SOCIETIES OF PERU


[Illustration: STREET SCENE ON THE FEAST DAY OF LA MERCED, LIMA.]

Charity and kindness of heart are qualities that radiate from moral
worth as truly as learning and refinement reflect intellectual
superiority, and the benevolent institutions of a country deserve to be
as great a source of pride as its schools and colleges. The
establishment of hospitals, asylums, and other charitable organizations
in Peru dates from the time of the Conquest; for, whatever may have been
the evils of colonial rule, they did not include negligence of the
duties of Christian charity. During the period of the viceroyalty,
asylums for the gratuitous care of the sick and destitute were founded
in Lima and other cities of Peru, the funds for their maintenance being
derived partly from donations, and partly from the rents of property set
aside to furnish a permanent and independent revenue for their use.

At the time of the Independence, Lima had many hospitals under the
management of religious brotherhoods. Belem and San Juan de Dios
received inmates at a fixed price of one dollar a day; and an English
traveller, who was a patient in the San Juan de Dios hospital a century
ago, has written a very favorable description of its cleanliness, good
ventilation, excellent diet, and the kind attention given to patients.
The hospital of San Andrés had accommodation for six hundred invalids
and capacity for twice that number, and was beautified by a magnificent
garden of rare botanical value. Santa Ana hospital, founded by an Indian
princess, the Caciqua Catalina Huanca, was consecrated to the needs of
her own people. Two hospitals, San Pedro de Alcantara and La Caridad,
were for women exclusively; and the sick and suffering among the negro
population were cared for in the hospital of San Bartolomé. By a law
passed in 1825, all the establishments organized by public charity, and
at that time in charge of the convents, were placed under the
administration of a _Junta de Beneficencia_, or Board of Benevolence,
which was later replaced by the Benevolent Societies, under whose
control are all the charitable institutions of the republic. There are
about fifty of these societies, each of which maintains and governs one
or more charitable establishments, the annual expenditure for this
purpose being two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling. Lima
spends more than half of this amount in the support of its hospitals and
asylums. The revenues are derived from grants of the national government
and the departmental boards, from the rents of the societies’ various
properties, from the profits of the public lotteries,—established during
the viceroyalty, and, by the decree of the republic, devoted to
charitable purposes,—and from the income derived from cemeteries, which
are under the administration of the Benevolent Society. In Lima the
lotteries provide a large fund for the purposes of charity, the annual
income from this source amounting to from thirty thousand to forty
thousand pounds sterling.

The Lima Benevolent Society is composed of a hundred members, from whose
number a board of directors is elected annually, with authority to
appoint two inspectors for each establishment of importance; one
inspector is appointed for each minor organization and for the religious
brotherhoods, whose incomes are administered by the society, the surplus
of their rents, after deducting expenses, being applied to its purposes.
The president of the board of directors is the general manager of the
society, who bears the title of Director of Benevolence. The gentle
heart of the Limeña is quickly moved to pity by the sight of suffering
and distress, and generous contributions are made to many charitable
institutions not included among those of the society, though the latter
extends its benign protection over all the city, performing its noble
task with great efficiency, through the aid of the pious Sisters of
Charity, who form a devoted corps of nurses and guardians in its
hospitals, asylums, and poorhouses. In Callao, Arequipa, Puno, Trujillo,
and Cajamarca, as well as in the capital, the visitor to the
institutions of charity meets these sweet-faced gentle ministers of
mercy.

The most important hospital of Lima was constructed soon after the
glorious victory of Callao in 1866, when the Spaniards were driven from
the Pacific Coast, and it was named, in honor of that event, the
Hospital Dos de Mayo. The Director of Benevolence at that time was Don
Manuel Pardo, who planned the edifice in 1868 and presided at the
inauguration of the hospital during his presidency, in 1875. It is a
spacious and handsome building, and the wards of invalids are separated
from the various departments of hospital service by beautiful gardens. A
thousand patients can be accommodated in the institution, though the
daily average is about six hundred men. The principal hospital for
women, the Santa Ana, is the oldest in Peru, having been founded by the
first Archbishop of Lima, in 1549. A new edifice has recently been
constructed for the use of the hospital, having the latest modern
conveniences. The maternity ward occupies a separate site, and serves as
a practical school for obstetricians. The hospital of Santa Ana has a
children’s clinic, and a clinic of ophthalmology. The new building is
fitted up with twelve separate wards, having forty beds in each, and a
special section for children.

[Illustration: OFFICES OF THE BENEVOLENT SOCIETY, LIMA.]

The old hospital of San Bartolomé was converted into a military hospital
after the establishment of the republic; it affords accommodation for
three hundred patients, and its expenses are paid by the state, only the
administration of its affairs being in charge of the Benevolent Society.
There is a special ward in the military hospital for prisoners awaiting
trial. The only conditions required of an applicant for admission to the
hospitals of the Benevolent Society are that the illness shall be of a
common nature, and that the poverty of the applicant must be proved. The
question of nationality or religion is not considered. The society
maintains an asylum for incurable invalids, to which are sent those
cases declared chronic or incurable by the attending physicians.

The asylums maintained by the Benevolent Society of Lima accomplish
great good among a class that is generally neglected. The Orphan Asylum
has two branches, one of which is for the care and protection of
foundlings, and the other for the education of orphan children of tender
age. The first is located in a large building, which has a revolving
cradle so arranged that, as soon as the infant is placed in it, a
mechanism carries the cradle inside, the little one’s identity being
completely lost as it passes from a world that offered no welcome to the
shelter of a home that receives it as a sacred charge. About two hundred
children live in the foundlings’ home, which is provided with nurses,
doctors, and the usual service of a well-regulated household. The second
branch of the Orphan Asylum gives practical instruction suitable for
children who are to earn their living later. The boys are taught some
trade, the workshops of the institution including those for the
instruction of shoemakers, carpenters, tailors, and printers; the girls,
as soon as old enough to learn, are sent to Santa Teresa to be
instructed in sewing, embroidering, millinery, and other handiwork. Near
the hospital of Santa Teresa is located the Asylum of Santa Rosa,
supported out of the funds of the Benevolent Society, supplemented by
the amounts received from the sale of embroideries, fine sewing,
artificial flowers, and other articles made by the inmates. In the
asylum of San Andrés, which in 1879 replaced the hospital of that name,
both boarding and day pupils are included in the benefits of charity,
the former numbering about a hundred children, and the latter three
times as many, of both sexes, between three and eight years of age.
Instruction is given in household work and in other practical subjects,
the children, at the same time, learning to read and write. A _crèche_
has been established where infants may be left during the day in charge
of a corps of nurses, while the mothers are at work.

The Instituto Sevilla is one of the most important charities in Lima. It
is named in honor of a philanthropic Peruvian, Don José Sevilla, who
bequeathed a large sum to the Benevolent Society for the purpose of
maintaining an asylum in which the inmates should learn occupations
suited to their sex. A hundred girls are educated in this school free of
charge, the period of apprenticeship lasting five years. In addition to
those already referred to, the Society directs a number of branches,
under various names, dedicated to the needs of the destitute. The
“Little Sisters of the Poor,” the “Infants’ Shelter,” the “_Olla_
(stewpan) of the Poor,” the “Ruiz Davila,” and others, not only provide
comfort and protection, but give teaching of a practical kind. For the
encouragement of economy and foresight, the society has established a
savings bank, with a section for mortgages, in which deposits earn four
per cent per annum interest. The Lazaretto is under the management of
the Benevolent Society, though in times of epidemic, the municipality
contributes half of the sum required for expenses. The care of the
insane is one of the charges of the Benevolent Society, and in order to
provide better accommodation for this class of unfortunates, a national
asylum is being built near Lima, which will receive applicants from all
parts of the republic. The asylum now has about four hundred inmates,
under the direction of the inspector appointed by the Benevolent Society
for this institution.

[Illustration: HOSPITAL DOS DE MAYO, LIMA.]

Among the important services performed by the society is that of
directing the burial of the dead. The public cemetery of Lima, which
covers an area of twenty acres, dates from the government of the Viceroy
Abascal, who first abolished the custom of interring the dead in the
church vaults. The present system of burial, known as the _Columbarium
Romano_, which consists of walls in which niches are built one above the
other, is familiar to all travellers in Latin countries. It was
necessary to overcome great prejudice in the beginning, a cemetery not
being looked upon as consecrated ground; but the interment there of the
Archbishop of Lima in 1808 sufficed to inaugurate the new system
successfully. The original construction of the Pantheon cost a hundred
thousand dollars. It is one of the most notable in South America for its
space and for the number and fine architecture of its mausoleums. The
entrance faces an open circle, or _plazoleta_, in which stands a marble
column crowned by a statue representing the Resurrection. On one side of
the Pantheon is the Civil burial ground for Protestants, and on the
other side is that reserved as a last resting place for the unbeliever.

In addition to the hospitals, asylums, and other institutions governed
by the Benevolent Societies in all the principal cities and towns, there
are numerous special charities supported by the departmental and
municipal authorities of the different centres, or maintained by church
societies and private philanthropy. The needs of the unfortunate receive
increasing attention as the public administration extends its vigilance
throughout the republic, and to the institutions already existing new
ones are constantly being added. The government recently granted
subsidies to the Benevolent Societies of Moquegua, Ayacucho, Huánuco,
Huancavelica, Huancayo, Caráz, Aplao, and Yungay. The hospitals of Tarma
and Moquegua have been enlarged and improved, and in the Amazon port of
Iquitos a new hospital is being constructed according to modern ideas
and plans. In the increasing progress and development of Peru, its
benevolent charities have received greater attention than ever, the
moral sentiment of the nation demanding that these institutions share in
the general blessing of prosperity.

[Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL, AREQUIPA.]




                              CHAPTER XVII
                 AREQUIPA—THE MISTI—HARVARD OBSERVATORY


[Illustration: ARCH AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE CATHEDRAL, AREQUIPA.]

Tradition says that when Maita-Ccapac first led his army across the
Apurimac River, some of his soldiers were so enchanted by the
attractions of the country, especially the picturesque valley above
which the snowy summit of the Misti glistens among the clouds, that they
asked the Inca’s permission to remain. “Ari, Quepay!” responded their
lord, “Very well,—Remain here!” and from this exclamation is derived the
name of the beautiful city that now brightens the valley at the foot of
the Misti,—Arequipa. In order to appreciate the full beauty of the site
chosen as a permanent home by the soldiers of Maita-Ccapac, it is
necessary to have traversed the arid desert of shifting, crescent-shaped
sanddunes that separate it from the Pacific, or to have journeyed across
the barren _puna_ that stretches out between this fertile valley and the
farther slopes of the Cordilleras. Contrast heightens the charm of the
scene that spreads out in matchless beauty, as the white city appears in
the midst of its fresh, radiant _campiña_, and one can appreciate the
enthusiasm with which poetic travellers have described it as “a pearl in
an emerald setting” and “a dove in an emerald nest.”

Behind the city, rising above the valley like the walls of an
amphitheatre, are three majestic peaks, Pichu-pichu to the east,
Chacchani to the north, and the white-crested Misti in the centre; and
far in the distance, beyond the valley, the snowy summit of Coropuna,
more than twenty thousand feet high, towers like a distant sentinel
guarding the approach to some sacred shrine. But it is the Misti that
dominates the scene, as one approaches the lovely valley. The grandeur
and sublimity of this noble peak lies not only in its altitude, over
nineteen thousand feet, but in its clear-cut conical form and in the
mantle of snow that perpetually crowns its summit. There is little about
its appearance to suggest the terrible explosions of flame and lava
which once burst from its crater, and the only fire the imagination can
associate with its pure white summit, is that of the altar of worship.
What an ideal temple it would have been for the Virgins of the Sun!

[Illustration: THE CRATER OF THE MISTI.]

The Misti has its legends—what volcano has not?—and we are told the
reason why its fire is now quenched and its red mouth sealed with snow.
Ages ago, when it was a monster of destructive passion, scorching with
its hot breath and poisoning with its venomous lava all the beautiful
things of the valley, the Children of the Sun complained to their
celestial father, beseeching him to stifle the evil genius and save them
from his malevolence. The Sun, the father of goodness, irritated by the
giant’s wickedness, drowned him in his own liquid fire, and sealed the
top of the _Cerro_ with a wafer of snow, more impenetrable than granite,
so that the monster might nevermore be able to breathe, in case some
evil spirit were to try to bring it back to life. Another legend says
that St. Thomas, when preaching in this region, was so indignant at the
presumption of this thing of fire and destruction, that he threw his
sandal into its crater, whereupon the colossus was calmed and made
incapable of any further mischief. The beautiful valley, released from
slavery to the whims of a cruel tyrant, has ever since shown gratitude
to heaven for its salvation by rendering every service to mankind that
abundant fertility could compass.

Leaving the fascinating realm of tradition for the more reliable ground
of history, one finds that the present city of Arequipa was founded by
Garcia Manuel de Carvajal, under Pizarro’s orders, in the year 1540, and
that it was christened Villa Hermosa, “Beautiful City”—a name as
appropriate to-day as when the lovely spot was chosen. Situated at an
altitude of eight thousand feet above the level of the sea, this
paradise of green gardens and sunny skies is an ideal place of residence
for those who seek a healthful climate and the blessings of perpetual
spring.

[Illustration: AREQUIPA AND THE MISTI.]

One of the motives that decided Pizarro to choose the base of the Misti
as a site for the construction of a colonial city was expressed in his
formal authorization, which set forth that, in the ten months that the
Spaniards had lived there, none of their number had died, though they
formed a considerable settlement. Favored by the circumstances that
bountiful Nature and human industry contributed to the new city from the
period of its foundation, Arequipa grew and flourished, and in the time
of the Viceroy Toledo, it received by the royal decree of King Philip
II. the honorable title of “very noble and very loyal.” A notable
compliment was paid to the ladies of Arequipa in this decree, which
compared them to the Roman matrons in devotion and self-sacrifice,
praising the spirit shown in the giving up of their jewels to raise a
royal donation, a few years before.

[Illustration: A CELEBRATION OF MASS ON THE SUMMIT OF THE MISTI.]

Arequipa is a “white city,” built of native stone from the inexhaustible
quarries of the Misti. The stone is of volcanic formation, white,
porous, and easily chiselled; in the older edifices, which were
constructed during the time of the viceroyalty, the façades are
exquisitely carved in designs as fine as lace work, showing how well
this stone lends itself to the beauties of decorative architecture.
Owing to the numerous earthquakes which have visited Arequipa in the
past, it is the custom to build only one and two-story structures, the
walls being sometimes more than three feet in thickness. Many of the
houses are built with a vaulted roof, the arch offering greatest
resistance to the destructive force of seismic convulsions. As there is
plenty of space available, the most costly residences cover a
considerable area, having large _patios_, or interior courts, which are
paved with ornamental tiles, and arranged with handsome _jardinières_ of
plants and flowers. Some of the _patios_ are beautified with trees and a
flower garden, while others have an artistic fountain in the midst.
Arequipa has not yet reached the period of congested thoroughfares and a
population that can be accommodated only by means of “skyscrapers.”
These huge towers with little more than pigeon-holes for rooms, which
are among the necessary evils of overcrowded modern centres, are still
unknown to the city of the emerald _ceinture_.

Arequipa is built on the banks of the river Chili, its streets
stretching out in all directions to the _campiña_, or green country
fields surrounding it. As in all Spanish-American cities the principal
square is the centre from which radiates the activity of the population.
It is popularly called the _Plaza Mayor_, and bears the official name of
Plaza de Armas, or “Military Plaza.” In Arequipa, the Plaza de Armas
presents a particularly attractive appearance, the Cathedral, which
extends along one side of this square, being a magnificent and imposing
edifice, while the arched _portales_ that overlook the remaining three
sides are picturesque examples of colonial architecture.

[Illustration: LOS PORTALES, AREQUIPA.]

The Cathedral is one of the oldest and most interesting temples of
Catholic America. Nearly three hundred years ago the decree was issued
for its construction, by Pope Paul IV., though it was not until the time
of his successor, Pope Paul V., that the work was begun, during the
reign of King Philip III, in 1612. The temple was built in accordance
with the custom of those days, the decorations of its arches and columns
being elaborate and of costly workmanship. Altars of cedar, carved in
beautiful design, were subsequently replaced by those of silver, the
abundance of this precious metal resulting in its lavish use for the
decoration of all the churches and convents of the viceroyalty. The
chancel occupied the centre of the chief nave and its seats were of
finest cedar, their carved backs showing in high relief the effigies of
the twelve apostles and other saints. In the sacristy were preserved
many rich treasures, consecrated vases of gold, sacerdotal vestments of
rare value, and a collection of portraits of all the bishops of Arequipa
from the earliest days. Many of these priceless possessions were
destroyed by fire in 1844, when everything perishable succumbed to the
flames that wrapped the great edifice in a lurid sheet. The silver of
the altars ran over the floor in a molten stream, all efforts to save
the precious ornaments being futile. The rebuilding of the sacred
structure took twenty years, and was little more than completed when a
terrible earthquake visited the city, in 1868, which, however, damaged
the Cathedral only slightly;—a proof of its excellent and solid
construction, since the shock was terrific and prolonged and resulted in
much loss of property.

[Illustration: PLAZA DE ARMAS, AREQUIPA.]

The Cathedral of Arequipa is one of the most admirable specimens of
church architecture in America. Its façade measures four hundred and
fifty feet in length; three entrances, and the support of seventy
columns of composite Ionic and Doric style, give a magnificent
appearance to the edifice. The peculiar advantage offered by its
location—dominating a spacious plaza—enhances the imposing effect of its
splendid architecture, which would have been dwarfed, from an artistic
point of view, in a less commanding site. The interior of the temple is
divided into three naves, separated by superb columns that support the
great arches above with harmonious effect. The main altar piece is of
marble and the pulpit is a work of superior art in carved wood. There is
an atmosphere of rest and peace within the walls of this noble edifice
that is felt not only by the pious worshipper who seeks this consecrated
place for the purpose of prayer, but even by the indifferent passer-by,
attracted within by the music of the splendid choir, or by the artist’s
appreciation of the beautiful.

Of earlier origin than the Cathedral, the construction of the church of
the Jesuits was begun in the sixteenth century, though it was not until
a hundred years later that its vaulted roof was finished. It is one of
the celebrated churches of Peru, both for its architectural importance
and its interesting history. The Dominican friars founded their convent
in Arequipa in 1582, and the present temple of Santo Domingo is among
the principal churches of the city. Nearly all the religious orders were
represented here during the viceroyalty, the Convent of Mercy having
been founded in 1548, while the existing edifice was built nearly two
hundred and fifty years ago. The Franciscans established their first
convent in Arequipa in 1552, the church of this order at present being
one of the largest and most beautiful in the city. There are three
nunneries here, Santa Catalina, Santa Teresa, and Santa Rosa.

[Illustration: STREET SCENE, AREQUIPA.]

The social life of the _Arequipeña_—the lady of Arequipa—is essentially
that of a refined, gracious, and charitable Christian, who esteems it
her greatest pleasure, as well as duty, to attend to the demands of
religion, and to extend to the sick and the needy the gentle kindness
which is characteristic of her, whether in the salon, the charity ward,
or the abode of suffering. The Orphans’ Asylum of Arequipa reflects this
spirit of kindness in its appearance and administration. It occupies a
spacious building, and connected with it are large gardens where the
children may run and play in the hours of recreation. About four hundred
children are accommodated in this institution, which is one of the
charges of the Benevolent Society. Under the same administration, the
Hospital of San Juan de Dios provides care and comfort to the suffering
poor, its matron and nurses belonging to the world-renowned order, the
Sisters of Charity. The new hospital is a credit to the enterprise as
well as the charitable spirit of the people, who have contributed to
make it one of the notable institutions of the country.

[Illustration: CHURCH OF SANTO DOMINGO, AREQUIPA.]

The schools of Arequipa, as well as its churches and charities, are an
indication of the refinement of its people and their appreciation of the
advantages of culture. The University of Arequipa has always been an
important centre of learning, presided over by men of illustrious
talents, and the various colleges of the city rank among the first in
Peru. The Colegio de la Independencia is a celebrated institution,
having trained for the service of the republic some of its greatest
statesmen. It was in Arequipa that the patriot Gonzalez Vigil learned
how to thrill the hearts of his hearers by his earnest and impassioned
appeals in favor of justice and liberal government; and he was one of
many who came from the schools of Arequipa to join their compatriots in
the struggle for good government that followed the inauguration of the
republic. The progress of education is as marked in the schools devoted
to the instruction of girls as in the boys’ colleges. The Colegio de
Señoritas, which is under the administration of the community of Our
Lady of the Rosary, and is directed by the Reverend Mother Elena Chaves
Delgado, is one of the best educational institutions of Peru. It was
founded in 1870 by the Reverend Mother, and for the past ten years it
has been under the present administration, the avowed object of the
school being “the religious, moral, and scientific improvement of the
attendants and the instruction and education of the girls, in accordance
with Catholic doctrine and morality, and conforming to the general rules
of public instruction.” A notable and admirable feature of the Colegio
de Señoritas is the practical character of the education provided. It
has been the constant aim of the college to instil into the hearts of
its pupils a love of virtue and habits of industry; not only are the
girls taught the lessons of books, but they are given an opportunity to
learn by practice all the duties of a household, and are prepared to
earn a livelihood should the necessity occur.

[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW OF THE BATHS OF YURA.]

[Illustration: AT THE BATHS OF YURA, AREQUIPA.]

In importance, the second city in Peru, Arequipa is the capital of the
department of the same name, and an important commercial as well as
political and social centre. The administration of the department is in
the hands of the prefect, Dr. Ximenes, whose authority extends to all
its provinces and municipalities. He is well known in political circles
for his progressive and enterprising ideas, and his government has been
one of steady improvement and development. The department is divided
into seven provinces: Arequipa, of which the chief city is the capital
of the department; Islay, with its chief city, Mollendo; Cailloma, with
its capital of the same name; Castilla, of which Aplao is the capital;
Condesuyos, having Chuquibamba as its political centre; Union, extending
north to the Department of Apurimac and dividing the Departments of
Ayacucho and Cuzco, with Cotahuasi its capital; and the province of
Camaná, stretching along the coast from Ica to the province of Islay:
the city of Camaná, named after the province, of which it is the
capital, and the city of Mollendo, are, together with Chala and Quilca,
the principal ports of the State. Mollendo is a modern city, connected
with Arequipa by railway, and is a stopping place for all the steamers
of the Pacific and the South American Companies between Valparaiso and
Panamá, as well as numerous other lines.

[Illustration: BOLOGNESI PARK, AREQUIPA.]

The local interests of the city of Arequipa are governed by the
Provincial Council, or Municipality. The present authorities have given
especial attention to the improvement of the city, devoting earnest
efforts to the carrying out of important public works. The previous
council constructed new _portales_ in the principal plaza, built the
Grau bridge over the river Chili, established the water works system by
which the city is supplied from Yumina, two leagues distant, and
accomplished other reforms. The existing council is making notable
improvements in the beautification of the Plaza de Armas; is
constructing a new market building suitable to the growing needs of the
city; and is perfecting the drainage system. The streets have been
improved and many of them newly paved; Bolognesi Park is now a more
charming _paseo_ than ever; and a new electric street railway is to be
established, which will connect the city with its beautiful suburbs. The
municipality pays especial attention to public health, and the
sanitation of the city is in charge of competent authorities who spare
no effort to ensure the most healthful conditions. The city and its
picturesque suburbs, Yanaguara and Tingo, are lighted by electricity.

Good roads are maintained throughout the department, and it is a
pleasant journey to visit the various points of interest in the vicinity
of Arequipa, which is surrounded by charming resorts for health and
pleasure. Tingo, Zemarrat, and Sabandia are noted not only for their
picturesque scenery but for the attractive appearance of their streets
and gardens.

[Illustration: AVENIDA DE TINGO, AREQUIPA.]

The thermal waters of Arequipa are celebrated throughout the Pacific
Coast, the springs of Yura and the Aguas de Jesus being known to
everyone familiar with this region. The latter are located about a
league from the city, on the slope of one of the _cerros_ belonging to a
chain that begins between the Misti and the Pichu-pichu and extends as
far as Paucarpata, just east of the capital. It is a pleasant outing to
visit the Aguas de Jesus, and many parties make the trip, to enjoy the
scenery along the route, which is superb, and to take advantage of the
beneficial waters. The spring is enclosed in a stone building, and is
under the direction of the Benevolent Society. Yura, which is two hours’
train journey from Arequipa, is a popular health resort, not only for
the people of the capital but of all Peru. Its baths are famous for
their curative qualities, and are of different kinds, including
sulphurous and ferruginous, which possess wonderful properties. Their
fame increases constantly as the remarkable benefits derived from their
use by citizens and travellers become known.

At a short distance from the city, on the slope of the Misti, the
Astronomical Observatory of Harvard University is situated. This
scientific institution was founded eighteen years ago, in order to
enable astronomers to make observations at the greatest possible
altitude above the sea level. The location of the observatory is perfect
for the purpose designed, and satisfactory results have been obtained.
At present this institution is under the direction of Mr. Frost, of
Harvard University. The local authorities extend every courtesy to the
scientists of the observatory, who speak in high terms of their
politeness and kindly interest.

The population of the Department of Arequipa is two hundred and forty
thousand, of which the capital city claims forty thousand. An
illustrious writer, referring to its people says: “The heart of the
Peruvian nation lives here.” The annals of its people show that in all
that has contributed to the nation’s greatness and prosperity, in all
that has grown out of patriotic sentiment and devoted loyalty, in
everything pertaining to the national spirit, as expressed in its
literature, its art, and its social advancement, the lovely valley at
the foot of the Misti has been represented by noble children, worthy of
a high place on the national roll of fame.

                             CHAPTER XVIII
                  A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNTRY


[Illustration: ON THE WAY TO MARKET.]

Although Peru lies entirely within the tropics, and close to the
equator, yet its climate cannot be called equatorial, nor is the
vegetation exclusively that of the Torrid Zone. Latitude has
comparatively little influence in determining its character, the chief
index to which is to be found in the remarkable physical features of
this extensive territory, one of the largest and richest of the South
American countries. The temperature here varies from equatorial heat to
arctic cold, and the products of all zones flourish within its
boundaries. Lofty peaks, clad in perpetual snow, look down from their
frozen summits on scenes of perennial spring-time; and, from these
lesser heights, the view extends over valleys and forests where summer
reigns throughout the year and Nature is riotous in her extravagances.

According to the best Peruvian authority, the republic extends from
north latitude 1° 29′ to south latitude 19° 12′ 30″; and from meridian
61° 54′ 45″ to 81° 18′ 39″ longitude west of Greenwich, covering an area
of about one million seven hundred thousand square kilometres. Its
boundaries are marked on the north by Ecuador and Colombia; on the east
by Brazil and Bolivia; on the south by Chile; and on the west by the
Pacific Ocean. The settlement of boundary disputes and the definite
establishment of limits between the different countries of South America
are problems that have long taxed the diplomacy of these nations and
proved a persistent drawback to their unity. By mutual agreement, it is
understood that the basis on which the disputed frontiers are to be
defined rests on the division of the territory made by Spain during the
colonial government and recognized at the time of the Independence. The
delays that have occurred in fixing these limits have made the task more
delicate with the passing of time, owing to the increased value of the
lands in dispute, the growing population and other circumstances; but,
fortunately, the vexed problem is rapidly nearing a final solution, most
of the rival claims having been already submitted to arbitration, and
many of them satisfactorily settled. The frontiers indicated in the
accompanying map represent the claims of Peru; though the limits between
this country and its northern and eastern neighbors, as here shown, may
be modified by the decisions that are to result from the arbitration of
friendly nations, chosen by mutual agreement to mark the dividing line;
on the south, the Camarones River forms the boundary between Peru and
Chile, though the latter occupies the provinces of Tacna and Arica
pending the plebiscite agreed upon in the treaty of Ancón.

[Illustration: LAKE OF LA VIUDA, IN THE HIGH SIERRA.]

Between the rainless region of the coast and the dripping forests of the
Montaña, the country is crossed by three mountain ranges that run
parallel through a part of their course, sending out transverse chains
at intervals, or joining together in great _nudos_, “knots,” that form
high plateaus in the midst of lofty peaks, covered with perpetual snow.
By this mountain system, Peru is divided into three distinct regions:
the coast, the sierra, and the Montaña, or wooded plains. The coast
region extends from the sea inland to the Cordilleras, reaching an
altitude of from three thousand to four thousand feet; the sierra
attains a height varying from ten thousand to eighteen thousand feet,
the high altitude, above the limit of vegetation being known as the
_puna_; the Montaña covers nearly two-thirds of the total area of Peru,
stretching from the eastern slope of the Andes to the frontiers of
Brazil and Bolivia.

The coast zone embraces a strip of land about fifteen hundred miles in
length, having an average width of from fifty to one hundred miles. From
the Gulf of Guayaquil, which forms its northern boundary, to the extreme
southern limit of this region the coast line is marked by a succession
of bare cliffs and shifting sandhills; though even this dreary prospect
has its peculiar charm when seen in the lights and shadows of dawn, or
in the still more marvellous colors of the sunset. One is reminded of
the glow that spreads over Alpine summits as the great orb vanishes; in
the fading light, the waters of the Pacific are as purple at the foot of
these rosy rocks as are the deep ravines below the Jungfrau. On this
strip of coast land, rain falls so seldom and in such insignificant
quantities as to be hardly worthy of mention. The only moisture which
the soil receives is derived from the rivers that traverse it on their
way to the sea from the Cordilleras, and the mists that prevail during
the winter season from May to August, caused by the southeast winds.

[Illustration: IN THE VALLEY OF ABANCAY.]

The lack of rain on the Peruvian coast is chiefly due to two important
circumstances, which explain why neither the winds from the Pacific nor
those from the Atlantic discharge any moisture on this sandy soil. The
prevailing winds from the Pacific blow from the southeast and carry very
little moisture, owing to their courses being parallel with that of the
Humboldt current,—a submarine stream from the antarctic, which follows
the line of the Peruvian coast throughout its entire length and has a
temperature seven degrees colder than the ocean; it is a hundred and
fifty miles wide, with a velocity of about a mile an hour. Besides the
southeast wind, a west wind blows across the Pacific, bringing plenty of
rainclouds; but it is checked by the stronger southeast current as it
approaches the coast, and its benefits are lost. The trade winds that
cross the Amazon plain from the Atlantic discharge a great amount of
rain in their course, but when they reach the high altitudes of the
Andean range, their vapor is condensed and falls in the form of snow, no
moisture remaining with which to water the narrow strip that lies
between the Cordilleras and the Pacific. The sea breeze, known as the
_virazón_, is strongest along the southern part of the coast, where,
during the winter months, it sometimes causes inconvenience in the
various harbors, on account of the heavy surf it creates. As a rule, the
Peruvian coast presents few difficulties to navigation. It is seldom
visited by storms, and there are no rocks, reefs, or shoals, to give the
mariner anxiety. A remarkable feature of the ocean in this region is the
appearance, during the winter season, of a current which is supposed to
be a prolongation of the equatorial stream, and which flows in an
opposite direction to the Humboldt current; it is known as the _niño_.

[Illustration: SCENE ON THE TUMBES RIVER.]

Only two seasons are perceptible in the coast region of Peru, the winter
months, from June to November, being cooler than those of summer, from
December to May. Fogs are frequent between December and April, though
they seldom last throughout the day. The heat is never intense, owing to
the influence of the Humboldt current, which modifies the effect of the
sun’s rays. Although apparently barren throughout a large extent of its
territory, the coast zone is really rich in production and supports a
large and flourishing population. In the subsoil of its arid plains,
valuable deposits of petroleum have been found; its uninviting deserts
contain saline beds of great commercial importance; and throughout its
length appear at intervals beautiful and fertile valleys, watered by
abundant streams and yielding enormous harvests of sugar-cane, cotton,
rice, and all kinds of fruits. The rivers of the coast, though numerous,
are of limited extent and volume, nearly all of them having their
sources on the Pacific Slope of the Andes and flowing directly across
the sandy strip of coast land to the ocean. During the summer, when
abundant rains fall in the upper ravines of the Cordilleras, the coast
streams carry plenty of water to irrigate the valleys; a few of them are
navigable for a short distance, but only for small craft. The valleys
drained by these rivers—about fifty in all—are like ribbons of green
crossing the brown sands of the coast; their existence is an indication
of the wealth which might be secured throughout the entire region by
artificial irrigation.

[Illustration: MONZON VALLEY, IN THE HUALLAGA REGION.]

The coast line of Peru presents few indentations. Its principal bays
are: Tumbes, in the extreme north, an inlet from the Gulf of Guayaquil;
Paita and Sechura on the coast of Piura; Chimbote and Samanco near the
northern border of Ancash Department, both large and beautiful bays;
Salinas and Callao, on the Lima coast; Pisco, San Nicolás, and the
famous Bay of Independencia, where San Martin landed the Liberating
Army, on the coast of Ica; and the picturesque bay of Arica. A few
notable capes and promontories mark the sea line, Cape Blanco being the
first point at which the coast curves southward after leaving the Gulf
of Guayaquil; and Point Parinas, the most westerly promontory of South
America. Near the coast, and presenting the same barren aspect, are
several groups of islands belonging to Peru, the most important being
Lobos de Afuera, Lobos de Adentro, and Guañape, in the north, and the
Chincha Islands a few miles from the port of Pisco, south of Callao,
noted for their rich deposits of guano. San Lorenzo Island, which lies
six miles to the southwest of Callao, serves as a protection to the
chief harbor of Peru. They are all desert rocks, though many interesting
prehistoric relics have been found on San Lorenzo which indicate that
this island was at one time the abode of a considerable population,
apparently of the same race as the pre-Incaic inhabitants of the
southern coast district.

[Illustration: ANCÓN, A COAST RESORT NEAR CALLAO.]

Leaving the coast for the sierra, one is impressed by the rapid change
of scene and the beauty of the landscape that unfolds to view in varying
aspects as the lower levels are left behind and the towering majesty of
the Cordilleras appears in closer proximity. The great Andean system not
only divides the region of the coast from that of the Amazon plain, but,
by its peculiar formation, gives to this part of Peru certain features
not to be found in any other country. Where the Andes mountains cross
the border between Peru and Bolivia, they consist of three high ranges,
viz., the Occidental and Oriental Cordilleras and an intermediary or
central chain. Near Lake Titicaca the Cordilleras join to form the Nudo
of Vilcanota; and about three degrees farther north, following a
northwesterly direction, they again unite in the Nudo of Cerro de Pasco.
The average height of the great ranges, from the Bolivian border as far
north as seven degrees south latitude, is from thirteen thousand to
seventeen thousand feet above sea level, a few peaks rising above twenty
thousand feet; then the altitude diminishes to an average of from nine
thousand to ten thousand feet, with frequent openings or passes not more
than seven thousand feet above sea level. Farther north, crossing the
border of Ecuador, the altitude is again increased to the limit of
perpetual snow. Between the mountain ranges extends a high uneven
plateau, broken by deep ravines and gorges, where transverse chains have
destroyed the regularity of the majestic Cordilleras; in this
inter-Andean region are also fertile valleys marking the courses of
streams which have their origin in the Nudos of Vilcanota or Cerro de
Pasco, and which flow between the ranges, until an opening occurs to
give them passage to the plains of the mighty Amazon.

The abundance of moisture carried by the winds from the Atlantic, and
deposited on the Andean summits in the form of snow, accounts for the
existence of several lakes at great altitudes in this region; in most
cases, an opening in the surrounding mountains has caused an overflow
into lower levels, thus originating the greatest river system of South
America. There are evidences in the plains and valleys of the high
sierras that these were at one time lakes, their waters having
disappeared in consequence of the gradual wearing away of the opening
and the levelling of the bed of the lake by sediments deposited in the
course of ages. A few of these inter-Andean lakes still remain. The
famous Lake Titicaca, which lies partly in Peruvian and partly in
Bolivian territory, and which covers an area of more than eight thousand
square kilometres, at an altitude of twelve thousand five hundred feet
above sea level, is one of the most remarkable bodies of water in the
world; it is the highest navigable lake on the globe, and is celebrated
in South American tradition as the cradle of the Inca dynasty. Steam
navigation was established on this lake in 1867, between the Peruvian
port of Puno, at the Titicaca terminus of the Southern railway from
Mollendo, and the Bolivian port of Guaqui, at the Titicaca terminus of
the La Paz railway. The trip across the lake by steamer takes from
twelve to fifteen hours, during which one may enjoy a most unusual
experience, not only “on a sea above the clouds” but at times in view of
a whole range of resplendent snow summits, glistening under a sky of
marvellous blue. Many rivers and streams flow into Lake Titicaca, though
only one, the Desaguadero, has its source in that lake. From the Nudo of
Vilcanota at the north flow the rivers Suchis, Huancane, and Ramis, with
their affluents; from the west, having their origin in the high sierra
between Arequipa and Puno, descend the Cabanillas and Lampa, confluents
of the Coata; and from the south, the Blanco, Juli, and smaller streams
empty into the great lake. Besides Titicaca, Peru has several lakes of
less extensive area, the most noted being the Laguna de Junin, famous as
the site of the historic victory won by the patriot army over the
colonial forces of Spain; Rimachuma in the Department of Loreto, and
Arapa in Puno, are of considerable importance.

[Illustration: THE BELL ROCK OF ETEN.]

[Illustration: QUEBRADA SANTA ROSA, ANCASH DEPARTMENT.]

The Laguna of Santa Ana, in the Department of Huánuco, though only six
square miles in circumference, is worthy of mention as the source of the
Marañon, one of the parent streams of the great Amazon River. It is
situated in the Nudo of Cerro de Pasco, a few leagues northwest of
Junin. The Ucayali and the Madeira—the latter with its tributaries, the
Beni and the Madre de Dios, being the longest of all the Amazon’s
tributaries—have their source in the Nudo of Vilcanota, and, like the
Marañon, have an inter-Andean course for a considerable distance before
entering the vast Amazon plain. On the route from Puno to Cuzco, at a
point called La Raya, the mountain summits surround a small basin, in
the midst of which is a little pond; from this insignificant beginning,
two streams take their course in opposite directions,—the Ramis, which
flows into Lake Titicaca, and the Vilcanota, afterward the Urubamba,
which, after forming a junction with the Apurimac, another important
river of this region, becomes the chief affluent of the Ucayali. The
Urubamba and the Apurimac run parallel along the separate valleys formed
between the Occidental and Oriental ranges by the intermediary chain
which accompanies them from the Nudo of Vilcanota northward, until the
three Cordilleras join again in the Nudo of Cerro de Pasco. Separating
north of Cerro de Pasco, these three great ranges form the valleys of
the Marañon and the Huallaga. The rapids, or “pongos,” which interrupt
navigation on nearly all the Amazon tributaries at some point of their
course, usually indicate a break in the enclosing Andean walls,
simultaneous with a change of their direction, the river resisting an
effort to turn its channel, and plunging through the narrow gorge that
affords it escape.

The rivers which have their source in Vilcanota or Cerro de Pasco are no
more than little rivulets of melted snow as they first appear in the
crevices of the high sierra; but they are fed by a thousand streams
along their course, and increase rapidly in volume as they flow toward
the plain, following the channel cut for them in the course of ages, now
carved so deep that, in some places, it lies at the bottom of a chasm
thousands of feet below the level of the bordering hills and plains. It
is only after leaving the region of the sierra that these rivers are
navigable, though they are capable of supplying unlimited motive power
for manufacturing and other purposes. Many of them are famous in history
and a few have claims to particular interest through their association
with the legends and traditions of the Incas. The Apurimac, across which
Maita-Ccapac swung the first American suspension bridge, has its source
in the Laguna de Vilafro, fourteen thousand feet above sea level, in the
Department of Arequipa. It receives many affluents, and, as it descends
into the lower valleys, drains a country rich in agriculture, one of the
most productive regions of Peru. It was on the border of this river that
General Sucre and his army were encamped by Bolivar’s orders, when the
news of the royalist army’s approach led to the rapid change of plans
which resulted in General Sucre’s becoming the hero of Ayacucho. To-day,
the beautiful valleys of this region blossom with the fruits of peaceful
industry, and thriving towns adorn its landscapes. Abancay, the
picturesque capital of the Department of Apurimac, is surrounded by
sugar plantations, and the _campiña_ is dotted with mulberry trees, the
silkworm industry being a profitable source of revenue.

The Urubamba River, like the Apurimac, flows through a fertile valley,
crossing the Department of Cuzco in a northwesterly course from the
border of Puno to the southern limit of Loreto, where it forms a
confluence with the Tambo—as the Apurimac is called after receiving its
last tributary, the Perené,—and enters the broad channel of the Ucayali.
The Urubamba has a number of tributaries, the most important of which is
the Paucartambo; along the courses of these rivers are fields of
sugar-cane, and in the lower valleys grow cacao and all tropical fruits.

The Marañon, and its tributary, the Huallaga, flowing northward from the
Nudo of Cerro de Pasco, water a region of surpassing fertility, in the
valleys of which are to be seen every variety of agricultural product.
The Marañon receives a great many tributaries from the Occidental range
as it flows northward across the Department of Huánuco, turning
northwest between Loreto and Ancash, and traversing the Department of La
Libertad. After dividing the Departments of Cajamarca and Amazonas for
some distance, it makes a curve to the northeast and, turning sharply in
an easterly direction, pursues a tortuous course until joined by the
Ucayali, to form the Amazon. In changing its direction from northwest to
east, the Marañon passes the “pongo,” or falls, of Manserriche, the last
and most important of a series of rapids which mark an effort to free
its current from the confining Andes. From the north, the Marañon
receives the Santiago, Morona, Pastaza, Tigre, and other tributaries,
while from the south, its chief affluent is the Huallaga. The greatest
variety of scenery and climate marks its course, which begins on the
high _puna_, in the midst of snowy peaks, and descends between mountain
slopes, on which cattle and sheep graze in perennial pastures, through
valleys dotted with orchards, and fertile levels where cotton, tobacco,
and sugar-cane grow, to the region of the Montaña, fruitful in cacao,
coca, and other products of a tropical zone. In the valleys drained by
the tributaries of the Marañon are situated some of the most prosperous
farms and plantations of Peru, though the wealth of this region has
never been exploited on a scale of sufficient importance to show what it
is capable of producing. Cajamarca, the capital of the Department of the
same name, and Chachapoyas, the capital of the Department of Amazonas,
are the most important industrial centres of this inter-Andean valley.

[Illustration: NATIVE BOATMEN ON LAKE TITICACA.]

Cajamarca, the historic city of the Conquest, celebrated as the site of
the capture and execution of Atahuallpa, lies in an oval plain
surrounded by mountains and traversed by the Camarca River, a branch of
the Marañon. Interesting ruins remain to give an idea of the great
structures built by the Incas or their predecessors, and the hot springs
are as efficacious to-day as they were when the last unhappy monarch of
Cuzco found them a source of royal comfort and pleasure. The valley of
Cajamarca is well cultivated, the inhabitants being industrious and
thrifty.

Leaving the inter-Andean region for the Montaña, it is interesting to
observe the contrast in scenery and natural conditions. In the Andean
valleys, the traveller who departs from the line of the railway must
journey in a coach or on muleback; in the Montaña, the small steamer or
the canoe is the accustomed means of travel through the forest, the
waterways of this region affording transportation throughout their
entire length. Among the most important rivers having their source in
the Montaña—generally in a ledge branching off from the foothills of the
Andes, are the Yavary, Yuruá, Purús, and some tributaries of the Madeira
River. The great waterways, with their affluents, form a network of
communication in the Amazon country, and contribute greatly to the
development of the rich resources of this vast zone, which is
essentially tropical, yielding the valuable products of the rubber tree,
the dyewoods, medicinal herbs and hardwoods of commerce, and other
precious gifts of nature.

With such a great variety of physical conditions as those which govern
Peru, it is not surprising that its climate should present many
contrasts, and some unique features. In the coast region, owing to the
proximity of the snow-clad Andes and the cold Humboldt current, the
average temperature is lower than that of any other country extending
over the same degrees of latitude; in winter, the thermometer registers
an average temperature of fifteen degrees centigrade, and in summer the
average is twenty-six degrees centigrade, the hottest days marking no
higher than thirty degrees in the shade. The mildness of the climate
makes this region of Peru an agreeable place of residence even to those
accustomed to the bracing air of the temperate zone; it is not so liable
to the epidemics of a tropical climate as are less favored countries in
the same latitude; and, with proper sanitation and the adoption of
modern hygienic measures, there is no reason why the Peruvian coast
should not be a paradise of health and longevity.

The climate of the sierra varies with the location and altitude of the
inter-Andean valleys and the plateaus that separate them. In the lower
slopes of the Cordilleras, the heat is greater than on the tablelands,
which have a temperate climate; while on the lofty, snow-clad summits of
the range, the cold is as intense as in the arctic regions. The seasons
of the sierra are divided differently from those of the coast; the rainy
season, from November to May, being called winter, and the dry season,
though colder, being known as summer. The average temperature, within
the populated region of the sierra, is ten degrees centigrade during the
day and five degrees at night, the absence of the sun making a great
difference in the atmosphere. The pure air of the plateaus is very
beneficial to consumptives, and Jauja, Tarma, Huancayo, and other towns
of the sierra have become famous as health resorts.

In the Montaña, the two seasons correspond to those of the sierra, the
wet season being from November to May, called winter, and the dry and
cooler season called summer. As the region of the Montaña slopes away
from the Cordilleras, its higher levels present the evidences of a
tropical zone in the exuberance of their vegetation, though the climate
is as cool and mild as that of southern Europe. Foreigners who live in
this region pronounce it healthful and delightful, as malaria is
unknown, and illness of any kind is a rare visitor. As one descends to
the lower Amazon plain, the heat becomes intense in places, though it is
generally modified by the daily showers and the cooling effect of the
trade winds. Taken as a whole, the climate of Peru may be considered
benign and healthful, and favorable to the acclimation of foreigners,
the conditions being such that every stranger may find, somewhere in the
country, the same climate as in his native land, or a better one.

[Illustration: A LAKE AMONG THE GLACIERS OF YAULI.]

The extensive territory of Peru, well provided by nature to meet the
needs of a great population, has at present between four and five
million inhabitants. The coast region supports one-fourth of this
population, having an average of 4.53 inhabitants to each square
kilometre; the sierra has about two-thirds of the entire population,
with an average of 5.32 to each square kilometre: and the Montaña, with
less than half a million inhabitants in its vast forests and plains,
shows only one inhabitant to every three kilometres. It is in this
region that the greatest opportunities are offered for colonization. Of
the total population, the official statistics give fifteen per cent to
those of European descent; fifty per cent are of Peruvian (Indian)
origin; two per cent are African, one per cent is Asiatic, and the
remainder are of mixed races, chiefly European and Indian. In the
predominance of the descendants of the Incas’ gentle and obedient
subjects is explained the peaceable and tractable character of the
masses, whose faults are rather those of indolence than of evil
intention. The governing class is chiefly of Spanish origin; and,
notwithstanding all that has been written to the contrary, their Latin
inheritance has peculiarly fitted them to be the rulers of this refined
race. The Spanish conquerors treated the Indians with great cruelty, it
is true, and reduced their number by forcing them to unaccustomed tasks;
but the Indians of North America hardly fared better under the zeal and
energy of the Puritan colonist, who instead of making them his servants,
drove them away from their homes, took possession of their country, and
gave himself no responsibility as to their future in this world,—though
earnestly seeking to teach them how to find a haven in the next.

Peru could very well support many times its present population, which is
only equal to that of Holland, though the Department of Lima alone
covers more territory than the entire Dutch republic. The Department of
Arequipa, equal to Switzerland in extent, and resembling it in
mountainous character, though having the advantage of several good
seaports, has only one-tenth of the population of that inland country.
England covers less area than the Department of Cuzco, yet has a hundred
times the population. One of the reasons for the limited European
population to be found in South American countries is their remoteness
from the great highways of travel, which have hitherto been between
countries of the northern hemisphere. But the twentieth century finds
the extension of international relations making rapid advances south of
the equator; and new steamship lines are being constantly inaugurated to
connect the ports of Europe and North America with those of the
trans-equatorial countries. Nearly all these countries have good
seaports and railway facilities for transportation to the interior. When
the Panamá Canal is opened, Peru will be placed within easy
communication with New York and Europe; in the meantime, the service is
being improved so that it will soon be possible to make the trip from
the Peruvian port of Callao to New York in ten days.

In a general description of the country, it is not possible to give
details regarding the many interesting features of coast, sierra, and
Montaña; the coast is closely related to its highland neighbor and may
even dispute boundaries, where the mountains crowd near to the sea; the
sierra and the Montaña encroach on each other’s domain in the equatorial
region, offshoots of the great Andean chain extending far into the
Amazon valley, while the virgin forest climbs high up the sides of the
Cordillera’s slope. Many of the coast departments extend inland to the
great range, and, as in Ancash, have their chief city in the sierra. Not
far from Huaraz, the capital of Ancash, rises the lofty peak of
Huascarán or Huascán, said to be one of the highest of the Western
range, and in the coast departments of Arequipa, Moquegua, and Tacna are
several extinct volcanoes, the summits of which are covered with
perpetual snow.

Owing to the fact that the various altitudes of Peru have a modifying
effect on the natural conditions of soil and climate, even though the
latitude is equatorial, the same kinds of products are found in nearly
all the departments, though each of the three natural divisions—the
coast, the sierra, and the Montaña—has also its own peculiar vegetation,
not to be found in the other regions. Along the coast are fisheries of
growing importance; the Peruvian government has engaged the services of
an expert from the United States to study the conditions most favorable
to pisciculture and the results are most satisfactory. According to a
recent report sent to the Minister of Fomento in reference to the
fisheries of Lobos de Afuera and Lobos de Tierra, there is an abundance
of fish off the shores of these islands. The _peje-aguja_, “needle
fish,” measures as much as two and a half feet in length; the
_anchoveta_, _peje-blanco_, _bonito_, _cabrilla_, _castañeta_, _charlo_,
_morena_ (three feet long), _sardine_ and _tiburon_ are among the
largest varieties, besides which there are innumerable small fry. These
islands have long been frequented by fishermen from the mainland, the
inhabitants of Eten, Pacasmayo, and other coast towns having established
a considerable trade in this product. In their primitive-looking boats,
called _balsas_, the fishermen carry provisions and other necessary
articles for a month’s sojourn on the islands, where they settle
themselves until they are ready to make the return voyage. As soon as a
fish is caught it is killed by a blow on the head, and each day’s
“catch” is salted after the fishing is over. Nets are rarely used in
these waters, the hook and line being usually employed.

But although the islands of Peru yield an abundance of fish, it is as
the centre of the guano industry that they are chiefly known. The
history of the Chincha Islands, of Lobos de Afuera and Lobos de Tierra
is especially interesting as it relates to the pelican’s haunts and the
wealth stored on their desert rocks by millions of these birds.

[Illustration: NATURAL ARCH OF STONE AT HUANCANE, NEAR LAKE TITICACA.]




                              CHAPTER XIX
                    THE WEALTH OF THE GUANO ISLANDS


[Illustration: PREPARING GUANO FOR SHIPMENT.]

Whoever has made a voyage along the coast of Peru must have noticed the
thousands of birds that flock in the neighborhood of the Chincha
islands, near Pisco, on the Guañape banks, off the coast of Trujillo,
and around the two island groups, Lobos de Tierra and Lobos de Afuera,
west of the Department of Lambayeque. Sometimes, when disturbed by the
steamer’s whistle or other unaccustomed noises, they rise in a black
cloud and soar away out of sight, to return later, one by one, in an
apparently endless procession. These are the pelicans of this region,
the producers of its famous guano, which was, at one time, Peru’s most
valuable source of revenue, and which is likely again to become a mine
of wealth to the country. When one reads that “a hundred thousand tons
of guano were exported from Peru to the United Kingdom last year,” it
seems to indicate that the trade is of no small importance, even at the
beginning of its revival. Not only on the islands named, but all along
the coast, these birds have their haunts. From a distance, the islands
appear sometimes to be covered with a huge black mantle, which, on
closer examination, proves to be the plumage of the birds that have
congregated on its shores, huddling together in an immense company.

[Illustration: THE HOUR OF SIESTA FOR THE GUANO BIRDS.]

The return of the pelicans and the revival of this trade are of
particular interest to those who have followed the history of guano in
Peru. For several years past the birds have been coming back to their
long-abandoned haunts in greater numbers than ever. The trade is
reviving under the most favorable conditions, and the government has
undertaken measures by which to protect the welcome visitors, and ensure
their remaining permanently. It is believed that, by taking due
precautions in the extracting of guano, so that the birds may not be
frightened away or forced to leave their nestlings, the danger of their
again abandoning the islands may be avoided, and their number may be
greatly increased. It has been especially recommended that the
exploitation of the islands should be made by turns; that a few of them
should be closed to the trade for a number of years, leaving the birds
in undisturbed possession, while others are worked, this plan to be
followed in rotation; and the advisability of granting exclusive
concessions for each island has been recommended. Under the authority of
the government, investigations have been made as to the existing
conditions, and the reports of those who visited the pelicans’ haunts
show that the problem of prime importance is how to keep the greatest
number of birds on the islands and increase their number without
prejudicing the best interests of the government, the national
agriculture, or the exporters. It is urged that the birds should be
treated with the greatest consideration and care, so that they may be
perfectly secure in their chosen homes, migrating only from one to
another island at long intervals, and so remaining almost undisturbed in
their habits from year to year.

The advent of these old friends is looked upon as an augury of bright
import by the Peruvian people, in view of the period of great trial and
disaster that followed the decline of the guano trade in years past. It
is certain that the revival of the industry will find Peru better able
to profit by its blessings than formerly, when the possession of an
apparently inexhaustible treasure led to reckless expenditure and
resulted in the financial difficulties that an unlimited credit,
continually drawn upon, invariably produces. In Alejandro Garland’s
recent book on Peru, an interesting history of the guano trade is given,
which places particular emphasis on the evils that developed out of its
phenomenal growth and peculiar conditions.

[Illustration: THE PELICAN AT HOME.]

In 1840, when the sale of guano first began to figure in the government
receipts, the total revenues of the country did not exceed three million
dollars. Ten years later, the government revenue from guano alone was
more than five million dollars. The demand for the product increased in
all parts of the world, and the annual exports rose to two hundred
thousand tons. This rapid increase in the guano trade was largely due to
the activity of the consignees, in whose hands the government placed it
for sale, and their influence in the financial affairs of the country
became very great. Every financial difficulty that arose at that time
was met by mortgaging the future returns from the sale of guano; and
Peru, counting on the extraordinary and abundant revenue from this
source met all the demands of the government without recourse to
taxation,—a condition unheard-of elsewhere in the financial history of
the world.

[Illustration: GUANO ISLANDS OF LOBOS DE TIERRA.]

But guano, though it brought to the Peruvian treasury the enormous sum
of two hundred and twenty million dollars between the years 1840 and
1867, brought also such habits of extravagance in the government, that,
not only did the entire sum disappear without adequate recompense to the
country, but, at the time when General Mariano Ignacio Prado assumed the
dictatorship, with Don Manuel Pardo as his Finance Minister, the public
debt was forty-five million dollars, besides which, the government also
owed the consignees of guano fifteen million dollars. Don Manuel Pardo
sought to organize the finances of the nation on a more solid basis,
independent of guano, by establishing permanent resources in the form of
taxes and export duties; but the fatal glamour of wealth with which
guano had dazzled the nation, cast his labor into the shade, and the
existing evil was increased in the succeeding administration, though the
intention of the energetic and public-spirited statesman, President
Balta, was to put an end to the mismanagement of guano funds by
employing this resource in the construction of railways and other public
works.

In the meantime, nitrate, a powerful rival of guano, had been discovered
in the desert of Tarapacá, then the southernmost province of Peru. The
companies engaged in extracting nitrate, of which about five million
quintals were exported annually, were competing with one another so
closely that the low prices established by them threatened to ruin both
the guano and the nitrate business; and President Manuel Pardo, in order
to raise the selling price of both products, with a view to increasing
the revenues of the nation, put into force a government monopoly of
nitrate. As a result of the war with Chile which followed, the nitrate
fields of Tarapacá passed into the possession of that country. The evils
of competition again threatened to ruin the trade, until, under the
auspices of the Chilean government, a system of limiting the production
was adopted, which remains in force. What Peru lost in the nitrate
fields of Tarapacá may be estimated from the statistics of Chile, which
show the revenue from the export of nitrate and iodine (the latter
obtained in the preparation of nitrate) to be five million pounds
sterling yearly, nearly three-fourths of all Chile’s exports being from
the nitrate fields.

[Illustration: DIGGING GUANO ON THE CHINCHA ISLANDS.]

Peru lost the revenues from both guano and nitrate under the same
stroke, and during the years that immediately followed, the country
passed through the darkest period of its history. But, as this
experience served to direct the attention of the nation to the more
permanent riches of this great territory, the loss of its most
attractive possessions cannot be regarded as an unmixed evil. From an
abundance of wealth, Peru was suddenly plunged into great poverty. But,
as with individuals, so with nations,—the test of the spirit lies in its
strength to meet adversity and overcome the discouragement that follows
in its path; and this test the Peruvian people met by resolutely facing
the task of building up their shattered fortunes through the development
of the national industries. Their territory is rich in agricultural
products and minerals; the rubber and hardwoods of the forest are
treasures of immense value; and the people have grown to realize the
full importance of developing these unlimited resources. As a result,
the sun of prosperity has again risen over the land; and in the warmth
of his beams, the harvests shed ever-increasing blessings and the hearts
of the people expand with content.

                               CHAPTER XX
           CALLAO, THE CHIEF SEAPORT OF PERU—STEAMSHIP LINES


[Illustration: MONUMENT TO ADMIRAL GRAU, CALLAO.]

Callao, the chief seaport of Peru, and one of the most important on the
Pacific coast, possesses an especial historical as well as commercial
interest. As the City of the Kings was the centre of political and
social authority under the viceroyalty, Callao was the headquarters of
its trade, the counting-house in which business operations connected
with the colonial service were carried on. All ships that traded between
Spain and its vast Peruvian provinces were obliged to load and discharge
their cargo in this port, where every article was registered and the
king’s duties were collected. The first buildings of the port were
erected in 1537, two years after Pizarro founded Lima; but it was not
until a hundred and thirty-four years later, in 1671, that Callao was
dignified with the title of city. In the intervening period, the
increasing wealth and prosperity of the viceroyalty and the importance
of its trade attracted pirates to the coast, the harbor of Callao being
made the chief point of attack, as in the case of Drake and Cavendish,
elsewhere referred to, and of the Dutch pirates who came later. These
invasions, though they wrought great damage to the city, were forgotten
in the flourishing period that followed, when Callao grew to be the
richest port of the Pacific and its harbor was constantly thronged with
vessels bringing in merchandise of all kinds, or loading precious
cargoes of gold and silver for the metropolis.

[Illustration: THE DOCKS AT CALLAO.]

A greater catastrophe than invasion of pirates befell the seaport in the
height of its prosperity, when, on the 28th of October, 1746, a terrible
earthquake, accompanied by a tidal wave of tremendous volume, completely
destroyed the city, about six thousand people perishing in the sea that
swept over the falling buildings in a deluge. The task of rebuilding
began at once, though not on the same site, which has ever since
remained under the sea. The location of the submerged city is indicated
between the points of Independencia and Camotal, south of the present
site, and in that part of the bay called the _Mar Brava_ (rough sea.)
For many years after this calamity, a sentry was stationed on the beach
to take charge of any treasure that might be washed ashore, and this
post was not dispensed with until after the inauguration of the
republic. When the new city was built, the port was fortified and placed
in charge of a strong military garrison. The part played by this
garrison in the last days of the viceroyalty is well known. Its
surrender was the signal of defeat to the royalist cause in Peru.

The foreigner who first sees the harbor and city of Callao from the deck
of a steamer, finds the view such a pleasing contrast to anything the
neighboring harbors have to offer, that he is not disposed to find fault
even with the barren aspect of San Lorenzo to the south, and the
monotonous line of houses facing the water front; he is charmed with the
beautiful green of the Rimac valley to the north, the distant glimpse of
Lima’s church towers, and behind them the purple hills that hide their
summits above the clouds. There is much to enjoy also in the busy scene
of the harbor; vessels of all nations are loading and discharging their
cargoes, tugs bustle about, and, while the pompous whistle of modern
steamers announces their arrival, the graceful sailing ship glides
silently into port, maintaining with dignity the credit of the good old
days, in the face of these rival _parvenus_ of twentieth century
transportation.

Nearly all passengers landing at Callao proceed immediately to Lima,
and, as soon as the routine of the custom house is finished, there is a
general rush for the train or the electric street car which runs to the
capital. If the foreigner were to be asked his first impression of
Callao, he would probably give a confused description of a place
remembered only for its Custom House, the narrow irregular streets and
old-fashioned houses of the water front, and the railway tracks to be
crossed on the way to the Station. But those who have seen Callao under
more favorable circumstances have found many attractions in the social
life of its kind and hospitable people and much to admire in the city
itself. Under the present administration, important improvements are
being carried to completion, notably the work of canalization, which
means a great deal to the healthfulness of the city. Block pavements
have been laid in the principal streets, the question of sanitation has
received special attention, and everything indicates a spirit of
progress active in public affairs.

[Illustration: THE CUSTOM HOUSE, CALLAO.]

The public buildings of Callao are situated chiefly in the central part
of the city, on one of the numerous squares, or plazas. The most
conspicuous of these edifices is the custom house, the chief _aduana_ of
the republic. It occupies the site formerly enclosed in the city’s
fortresses, and is a spacious building; though, it is claimed, the
accommodations do not fulfil the requirements of an establishment of
this kind, as the first custom house of Peru. The post office building
is a solid, well-built structure, overlooking the plaza; the prefecture
occupies a large and commodious building, the lower part of which is
used for the offices of the police authorities, the Junta Departmental,
the treasury and the criminal court; the civil court holds its sessions
elsewhere. Callao has a town council, a chamber of commerce, an
excellent fire brigade composed of four companies, a benevolent society
which maintains the hospitals of Guadalupe and San Juan de Dios, several
churches, and three social clubs. There are two protestant churches in
the city and two foreign clubs. The English Club has its headquarters in
a building overlooking the bay; its broad verandahs, adorned with shrubs
and plants, present a very attractive picture from the landing-place.
For amusement, there is a theatre and a bull ring, and lovers of sport
have their rifle and regatta clubs, besides which there is also the
Naval Club and the Italian Club. In the principal plazas of the city,
monuments have been erected in honor of the national heroes. The Plaza
Grau has a handsome monument in memory of the heroic commander of the
_Huascar_; a statue of General San Martin adorns the beautiful Plaza
Matriz; and in the Plaza “Dos de Mayo” stands a marble pillar,
supporting a bust of the hero José Galvez, Minister of War, who was
killed in the naval battle of 1866, in the bay of Callao.

[Illustration: STATUE OF THE LIBERATOR, CALLAO.]

The constitutional province of Callao was created by a decree of the
supreme government in 1836, the name “constitutional” being bestowed by
law in 1857, in remembrance of various occasions when its people had
defended the constitution of the State. The province extends from the
Rimac River on the north to the Mar Brava on the south, and from the
Pacific Ocean on the west to the haciendas Chacra Alta, Taboada, and La
Legua on the east. It includes the city of Callao, the wards, or
_barrios_, of Bella Vista and La Punta, and the islands of San Lorenzo,
Fronton, Palominos, Hormigos de Afuera, and neighboring rocks. The
province is governed by a prefect, an intendant of police, commissaries
and governors. Bella Vista and La Punta are under the authority of
commissaries. The present population of Callao is thirty-five thousand,
of which one-tenth are foreigners. Its chief industries are those
connected with maritime traffic, though the city has also a number of
factories and flour mills. The port is connected with the capital by
telegraph and telephone systems, and with all the cities of the world by
the Central and South American Telegraph Company, and the West Coast of
America Telegraph Company. Most of the consular offices are located in
Callao, which is within twenty minutes’ ride of Lima, on the electric
car. A business man may reside at the capital without any inconvenience
in getting to and from his office. The ride itself is a pleasant
_paseo_, across open country, with agreeable scenes all the way.

[Illustration: UNLOADING LUMBER AT CALLAO.]

Bella Vista is situated a mile east of Callao, where it was founded
after the earthquake of 1746, by order of the viceroy, the Count of
Superunda. Here the ship-owners, who had charge of the coasting trade at
that time, made their homes; and here were established warehouses for
the storage of wheat purchased from Chile to supply the market of Lima
and its neighborhood during the viceroyalty. These old buildings have
now been replaced by modern storehouses. In 1834, the government of Peru
ceded to the British Legation a piece of land for the purpose of a
Protestant cemetery, and here many distinguished foreigners have been
laid to rest. A mausoleum, erected by the Peruvian nation as a proof of
gratitude to the hero of the Independence, marks the grave of General
Miller, San Martin’s faithful follower.

[Illustration: CALLAO HARBOR.]

La Punta is the favorite bathing resort of Callao and of the capital,
its beach being thronged throughout the summer season. Its situation
marks the southern limit of the harbor, to which it forms a protection
from the southeast winds, stretching out for more than a mile into the
sea. The harbor is usually entered from the north, the narrow passage
between La Punta and the island of San Lorenzo, on the south, being
seldom frequented. The bay is large and affords safe anchorage for ships
at all times of the year. The only islands in the vicinity are San
Lorenzo, Fronton, Palominos, and a few small rocks. San Lorenzo is used
as a depository for explosives, and from its quarries are taken stones
for paving and other purposes; besides which it provides a good cement
for construction work. On the little island of Palominos, south of San
Lorenzo, stands a lighthouse, with a revolving light visible eighteen
miles distant. The government of Peru is putting up new lighthouses all
along its coast, thus meeting an urgent need. Another demand which is
being met with especial endeavor is the improvement of all the docks and
landing-places of the various ports of the republic. Callao’s dock and
wharf, called the Muelle Darsena, is built so that ships may disembark
passengers and cargo directly on shore, without requiring, as in nearly
all other ports of the Pacific, canoes and lighters to transfer them. In
some ports of the West Coast, both in North and South America, the
passengers are swung over the ship’s side in baskets; but, though the
novelty of the experience may have its charm, this is not a very
comfortable mode of landing. The Muelle Darsena at Callao permits of
ships of large tonnage anchoring close to its wharf. It encloses a space
covering more than fifty thousand square metres, has a pier one hundred
and eighty metres long, formed by the extension of one of its side
walls, and connects with the shore by means of a bridge nine hundred
metres long, constructed on iron piles. In addition to the Muelle
Darsena, the port of Callao has a floating dock with capacity to admit
vessels drawing twenty-one feet of water and registering five thousand
tons; and another floating dock is under construction which will admit
vessels of up to seven thousand tons’ register. During the past year
many improvements have been initiated, one of the most important being
the plan of fortifying the port, in accordance with the best modern
system. A new embankment, or breakwater, the “Malecon Figueredo,” is
under construction, which will add greatly to the attractiveness as well
as the protection of that part of the city which overlooks the harbor.
In this work, the supreme government coöperates with the Junta
Departmental and the municipality, all being benefited by its results.
In giving attention to the improvements that contribute to make Callao a
better port, the government believes that the commerce of the country
will be greatly advanced thereby. Callao is now visited annually by five
hundred steamers and more than a thousand sailing vessels besides the
smaller craft engaged in the coasting trade. Every day in the year, one
may count twenty or more steamers and twice as many sailing ships
anchored in the harbor.

[Illustration: PIER OF THE ARSENAL, CALLAO.]

[Illustration: PASSENGERS LANDING AT ETEN FROM A STEAMER OF THE PACIFIC
LINE.]

The most important steamship companies of the world are represented in
the lines which include the port of Callao in their itinerary. The first
company to send steamers to the Pacific Coast was organized largely
through the initiative of shippers in this port. The Pacific Steam
Navigation Company, incorporated in England by Royal Charter in 1840,
began its service on the Pacific Coast under the usual difficulties
attending pioneer efforts. The working of the line was impeded by
innumerable drawbacks. At first it was a purely coastal service and the
mails, passengers and through traffic had to be conveyed across the
isthmus of Panamá on mules. Then the Panamá railroad was built and the
traffic was fostered; but the rates across the isthmus were very high
and the difficulties that attended the despatching of through traffic
were so discouraging that the Pacific Company instituted a line of
steamers between Liverpool and Valparaiso _via_ the Straits of Magellan,
to connect with the coast service plying between that port and Panamá.
Later, the line from Liverpool was extended to Callao, and for many
years this port was the headquarters of the company, until, in 1896,
owing to a falling off in trade after the decline of the guano industry,
the chief offices were transferred to Valparaiso. Of late years,
however, the company has greatly increased its fleet, and a special line
of passenger and cargo boats has been put on for service to Peruvian
ports. From a small commencement with two wooden paddle steamers of
seven hundred tons’ register, as described by Mr. Frederick Alcock in
his book _Trade and Travel in South America_, the fleet has grown until
its register now approximates two hundred thousand tons. Its new
steamer, the _Orcoma_, has a tonnage of eleven thousand five hundred,
and the _Orita_ registers nine thousand two hundred and sixty-five tons;
in addition to these handsome floating palaces, the fleet numbers
eighteen twin-screw steamers of lesser tonnage, all of modern
construction and commodious service. Of these, the _Oriana_, _Ortega_,
and _Oronsa_, are the largest and most noted for comfort and elegance.
At Chucuito, near Callao, where the company owns a large property, the
stores and works are being enlarged and improved. The Pacific steamers
connect with those of the Royal Mail both at Panamá and Buenos Aires,
the latter having no line on the west coast of America, though its
magnificent fleet ploughs all the seas, from Southampton to Panamá, to
Brazil and Argentina, to the Mediterranean, Suez Canal and India, and,
in the Pacific Ocean, to China and Australia.

In addition to the Pacific Steamship Line, there are numerous others
trading along the west coast of South America, all of which call at the
port of Callao. The South American Steamship Company of Chile has
steamers every week from Valparaiso to Panamá and the ports of Peru. The
Kosmos Line connects the European ports of Hamburg, Bremen, Antwerp, and
Havre with San Francisco, California, _via_ the Straits of Magellan and
west coast ports of South America. The “Merchant Line” carries on a
direct trade between New York and Callao, and the Japanese Steamship
Company connects the Peruvian ports with Japan.

Almost all the American and European steamship companies have lines to
Panamá, including the Panamá Railway Steamship Company and the Leyland
Line, from New York; the Royal Mail, from New York and England; the
Hamburg-Pacific, from Germany; the Compagnie Général Transatlantique,
from France; the Veloce, from Italy; the Transatlantica Española, from
Spain; and the Pacific Mail, from San Francisco. As soon as the Canal is
open for traffic, all these lines will extend their itineraries to
Callao, which is destined to be the commercial metropolis of the South
Pacific.

                              CHAPTER XXI
                AGRICULTURE AND IRRIGATION ON THE COAST


[Illustration: PICTURESQUE GARDEN ON A RICE PLANTATION.]

The increasing importance of Peru’s seaport trade is largely due to the
prosperous development of agriculture, which is annually becoming a more
valuable source of revenue to the country. Nearly all the steamers that
visit Callao call also at other Peruvian ports, the coast being dotted
from Tumbes to Arica with flourishing harbors, in which may be seen
trading vessels of all nations. From the valleys of the coast region are
shipped immense quantities of sugar and important cargoes of the famous
Peruvian cotton, grown exclusively in this country, besides tobacco,
rice, coffee, and a variety of fruits. Agriculture is the chief
occupation of the people in this part of Peru, and the employment of
modern methods in its development is leading to wonderful results.

The conditions that govern agriculture on the Peruvian coast are similar
to those of the Nile valley, as regards the nature of the soil, climate,
and fertilization. Wherever a stream crosses the sandy strip between the
Cordilleras and the sea, the valley along its course is made richly
productive, and yields abundant harvests. Every effort is being put
forth by the government to increase the irrigable territory by
distributing the water of the rivers to the best advantage and by
sinking artesian wells wherever practicable. The special code which
governs irrigation on the coast has recently been reformed so as to
admit of a more general utilization of the water supply from the rivers;
and experienced hydraulic engineers from the Geological Survey
Department of Washington, District of Columbia, have been engaged to
study the geology of the coast, the courses of its streams, its
subterranean waters, etc., in order that, from correct knowledge, the
best means may be employed to utilize its moisture so as to benefit the
greatest possible area.

[Illustration: IRRIGATING CANAL ON A PIURA PLANTATION.]

At present, not more than two million acres of coast lands are planted,
out of a cultivable territory of fifty million acres, showing that the
farming industry is still in the infancy of its development. But the
harvests actually secured, with comparatively little effort and expense,
are in some cases phenomenal, and always abundant. When once the entire
area is brought under the plough, Peru will have in its coast farms
greater wealth than its mines have ever yielded. Not only through want
of irrigation is the productive area much less than it would otherwise
be, but the lack of laborers to cultivate the land is a serious
drawback. Some of the large haciendas contain extensive fields of
fertile soil that remain untilled because the owners have not sufficient
capital, or a large enough staff of workmen to undertake their
development.

[Illustration: LOADING SUGAR-CANE, SANTA BARBARA PLANTATION, CAÑETE.]

But, in compensation for its difficulties, agriculture has many
advantages on the coast of Peru. No sudden changes of temperature occur
to alarm the planter, there are no destructive storms, and the fear of
drought does not exist, because the system of artificial irrigation
permits of the fields being watered or left dry at the owner’s
discretion. Sugar, the chief product of the coast country, is cultivated
all the year round, the cutting of cane taking place without
interruption on the great plantations that stretch along its valleys.
Tumbes, Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Ancash, Lima, Ica, Arequipa, and
Tacna have extensive sugar plantations, though from Ica southward,
little is exported. The chief sugar-growing districts of the southern
coast region are Cañete, in the Department of Lima, and Chincha, in the
Department of Ica. From their seaports, Cerro Azul and Tambo de Mora,
large cargoes are shipped to foreign countries, as well as from the port
of Pisco, at which all the ocean steamers and sailing vessels of the
west coast call to receive and discharge merchandise. The large sugar
estates of Cañete and Chincha are conducted according to modern methods,
those of the British Sugar Company and the haciendas of San José and
Larán being the most important in extent and production. The great
centre of the sugar industry in Peru is the Chicama valley, in the
Department of La Libertad, where the average production reaches four
tons to the acre, a larger return than is secured in any other
sugar-growing country. The total quantity of sugar produced annually in
Peru amounts to about two hundred thousand tons, of which the greater
part is grown on the coast, more than a hundred and fifty thousand tons
being exported. It is estimated that the value of the year’s harvest
averages between eight and nine million dollars. In nearly all the coast
districts, flourishing cotton plantations may be seen, though the
valleys of Piura are most celebrated for the successful raising of this
product, which occupies the second place among the agricultural exports
of Peru, the annual shipments amounting to twenty thousand tons, with a
prospect of rapid increase, owing to the added extent of territory
annually placed under cultivation. In the valleys of Huacho and Supe, in
the Department of Lima, the famous “Sea Island” cotton is grown, and all
the coast states produce the “Egyptian” and “Mitafifi” varieties.
Peruvian cotton is exported only from Piura and Ica.

[Illustration: PIER AND WAREHOUSES OF THE BRITISH SUGAR COMPANY,
LIMITED, AT CERRO AZUL.]

In the northern coast region, notably in Lambayeque and in the province
of Pacasmayo, in La Libertad, the culture of rice receives especial
attention, with the most satisfactory results. Modern methods are
employed by the planters of this zone to increase the production, which
now averages two hundred and fifty thousand bags (one hundred and ninety
pounds each) annually. The rice of Peru is equal to the best grown in
other parts of the world. Two varieties are cultivated, the “Carolina”
and the “Jamaica,” the former being more prolific, though the “Jamaica”
gives a whiter grain and is more easily hulled. In good years, the
harvest amounts to fifteen bags to the acre, and the cost of production,
from the planting of the seed to the harvesting and threshing of the
grain, is about eight dollars, gold, per acre. The value of the rice
crop varies greatly, but the present average is not less than half a
million pounds sterling.

[Illustration: FERREÑAFE, A FLOURISHING CENTRE OF THE RICE INDUSTRY.]

In the Peruvian rice fields, the harvesting begins five months after
planting; the rice is then gathered and sent to the mill to be hulled,
the larger estates having their own rice mills, provided with all the
latest improvements. The Chiclayo valley, the chief centre of the
rice-growing region, is fertilized by the Chancay, Saña and Leche
Rivers, and their tributaries. From the Chancay River, at a point called
Puntilla, an irrigating canal, the Taimy, crosses the valley, watering
the estates in the district of Ferreñafe, which is in the heart of the
rice country. From the seaport of Eten, a railway extends inland for
fifty miles, passing the principal towns, rice fields and sugar
plantations of the department. It is a standard gauge line, and the cars
are of modern construction. The port of Eten is interesting chiefly as
the gateway to the rich country behind it, though the town itself is
constantly growing and improving. The most conspicuous feature of the
port, as seen from an incoming steamer, is its long pier, which extends
two thousand seven hundred feet out into the sea, and is provided with
steam winches having capacity for disposing of seven hundred tons of
cargo daily. Similar piers have been built at Pacasmayo, Salaverry,
Pisco, and other ports. The railway from Eten, after leaving the port
and passing Monsefu and Chiclayo,—the latter the capital of
Lambayeque,—traverses the beautiful valleys where the rice fields
stretch out like a green carpet along the banks of the river. Great
haciendas, of extensive acreage, speak volumes in praise of the
enterprise and energy of the proprietors, in a region less than seven
degrees from the equator and almost at sea level. Pomalca, Combo, Tuman,
Patapo, and other important plantations, are provided with American
agricultural implements and have the latest machinery of all kinds in
their fields and rice mills. Sugar is also grown in these valleys, the
annual harvest amounting to twenty-five thousand tons.

[Illustration: A HOLIDAY IN CHICLAYO.]

Although La Libertad is called the “Sugar State” of Peru, Piura its
“Cotton Belt,” and Lambayeque the rice-growing centre, yet all these
products are cultivated also in the fertile valleys of Ancash, which is
one of the richest and most promising departments of the republic,
comprising, within its twenty thousand square miles, the regions both of
the coast and the sierra. It has excellent harbors, abundance of
irrigation, a great variety of resources and a healthful climate. The
sugar farms and rice fields of Ancash are chiefly located in the
northern part of the state, in the beautiful valley of the Santa River,
and in the region of Samanco and Casma. All this territory is
particularly adapted to agriculture and is destined to be one of the
richest centres of Peruvian industry. The magnificent bay of Chimbote,
covering a surface of thirty-six square miles, affords shelter for the
largest ships and is one of the best harbors on the west coast of South
America; it is free from sandbanks and hidden rocks, and never gets the
rough seas that sometimes break over the shores of other ports along the
coast of Peru. Before the war with Chile, a railway was under
construction to connect the port with the capital, Huaraz, and half the
road was completed when the war broke out. All the workshops and
factories were destroyed by the invading troops, who set fire to the
fields of sugar-cane and blew up the farm houses with dynamite. This
catastrophe paralyzed the progress of the valley for some years, but,
under renewed enterprise, the outlook is very bright for future
prosperity. The railway is being built again and will soon be completed
to the capital of the department, thus affording facilities of
transportation for the products of the sierra as well as those of the
valleys. Abundant water-power is available for engineering and other
enterprises.

[Illustration: WORKMEN ON A COAST PLANTATION.]

[Illustration: STREET AND OLD CHURCH OF LAMBAYEQUE.]

None of the agricultural products above named are confined to the coast
region. In the lower inter-Andean valleys and on the higher levels of
the Montaña sugar, cotton, and rice are successfully grown, though not
as the chief industry, except in the case of sugar, which is a staple
product of all the interior valleys. Tobacco thrives better in the
interior than on the coast, though the province of Tumbes produces some
of the best tobacco of South America. Maize is cultivated in every
department, and in every region except on the high _puna_. It may be
seen growing on the plantations of the coast, in the inter-Andean
valleys, and in the Montaña, and furnishes the Indian’s chief article of
food and drink; the native _chicha_, once the favorite beverage of the
Incas, is made from this product. Maize is to the Peruvian Indian what
rice is to the Oriental, the foundation of his _cuisine_. The history of
its discovery is interesting. It is said that, when Christopher Columbus
landed on the Island of San Salvador in the Bahamas, in 1492, he and his
followers were surprised to find that the natives prepared a most
palatable food from a plant that was quite unknown to the conquerors and
had never been seen in Europe. The natives called it _mahiz_, which the
Spaniards corrupted into _maiz_ (pronounced like the English word
“mice”), and it has ever since retained this name, having become one of
the principal agricultural products of the world. The valley of Chancay
is famous for its maize, the production of this district alone amounting
to about ten thousand tons annually; though Cuzco enjoys the reputation
of growing the largest maize in the world, with grains the size of a
large bean. Peruvian maize won a gold medal at the St. Louis Exposition
in 1906, and was the subject of great interest among agriculturists.

[Illustration: PATAPO, DEPARTMENT OF LAMBAYEQUE.]

Agriculture is awakening greater interest than ever before in Peru. The
government, through the Department of Fomento, is doing everything
possible to encourage its development; the National School of
Agriculture and veterinary science has been most successful as a means
of providing practical instruction in this important branch of
education. The school was founded in 1902, the first pupils being
graduated in 1906. Many young Peruvians have studied agriculture in the
United States and Europe, and, on returning home, have put in practice
on their haciendas the knowledge thus gained. A few have become teachers
in the National School of Agriculture, which is accomplishing a great
work for the future of Peruvian industries. The Department of Fomento
distributes, free of cost, to the agricultural community a great
quantity and variety of illustrative literature respecting modern
methods of cultivation, irrigation, and fertilization of lands, with
suggestions as to the best kinds of products to be fostered in certain
regions; a bulletin appears monthly, filled with useful information, and
the school of agriculture publishes a newspaper along the same lines.
The government also imports seeds and special plants from other
countries and lends its aid to the planter in exterminating any diseases
that may appear on his lands.

The laws of Peru authorize the government to grant concessions of waters
and lands on liberal conditions, which are attracting agriculturists
from less favored zones. Companies have been formed with the object of
securing irrigation on lands hitherto not within the cultivable area,
and the system of irrigation has been increased in various sections. In
the Department of Piura, the irrigating canals on the Chira and Piura
Rivers have greatly enhanced the value of lands in that section; and
similar results have followed the work done in Lambayeque and in the
Chicama valley. The effort on the part of the government to place the
coast lands under irrigation is not of recent date, the records showing
that measures were adopted to promote enterprises with this object in
view as early as 1861, when authority was given, by a supreme decree,
“to sink artesian wells for irrigation and domestic uses in Paita and
Piura.” During the presidency of Don Manuel Pardo, especial attention
was given to the problem of irrigation, and agriculture was developing
under the most auspicious circumstances when interrupted by the war of
1879. As soon as peace was restored and the country resumed its normal
tranquillity, the importance of irrigation again occupied the public
mind, and from that time to the present,—though notably during the
administration of Don José Pardo,—improvements have continued to be made
and new experiments studied for the benefit of the agriculture of the
coast by a more thorough and general irrigation of its territory.
Another question besides irrigation is now occupying the attention of
agriculturists. Heretofore, the wonderful fertility of the soil has been
perpetuated by allowing fields to lie fallow for a season, whenever
their productiveness threatened to decline. This system is giving place
to the more scientific method of fertilizing the land by the use of
guano and other substances suitable for the purpose, and no country is
better provided than Peru with the best fertilizing products of the
world. The islands from which this valuable food for the soil is
obtained are all within easy sailing distance of the coast, and their
supply is sufficient for the needs of the country for an indefinite
period.

                              CHAPTER XXII
                    TRUJILLO AND THE CHICAMA VALLEY


[Illustration: HUACO DEL SOL, TRUJILLO.]

As the valley of the Nile became the seat of Egyptian civilization when
all the rest of Africa was in barbarism, so, in the western world, the
valleys of the coast region of Peru formed the centre of social and
industrial development at a period more remote than is indicated by
existing evidences of any other culture on the South American continent.
In the primitive history of mankind it is under the most favorable
conditions of soil and climate that the greatest social development is
to be traced, and in no part of the world had the simple child of nature
apparently less to fear from the elements or more to hope from the
beneficent earth than in these smiling valleys. There is no doubt that
in ancient times the irrigation of this extensive area was more general
and its desert tracts were fewer than at present; and the efforts of the
Peruvian government, now directed toward a scientific investigation of
the subsoil of this region, aim especially to discover, if possible,
some means of restoring these sources of moisture, which were once
sufficiently abundant for the fertilization of a vast realm inhabited by
a population many times in excess of what it is at present.

Trujillo occupies the site on which flourished, long before the advent
of the Incas, the rich and powerful capital of the Chimus. Their palaces
and temples were spread over a great extent of territory, and the ruins
of their culture are to be seen in all the valleys of this part of Peru.
Whether the earliest builders of these prehistoric piles were the Chimus
or a still more ancient race has not been determined: but in the
neighborhood of Trujillo and in the valleys of Chicama, Santa Catalina,
and others, exist to this day evidences of an architecture of very great
antiquity, and of such a character as could only have been produced by
an intelligent and cultivated people. At the time of the Spanish
conquest, the Incas had gained the ascendancy in the valley of Chimu,
extending some two hundred leagues along the coast from Tumbes
southward, but its tribes were by no means willing allies of the
sovereign of Cuzco. When the Spaniards appeared, they were welcomed as
superior beings sent by heaven to avenge the injuries which the subjects
of the powerful Chimu Canchu—The Grand Chimu—had suffered at the hands
of Pachacutec’s son, the Prince Yupanqui.

[Illustration: GALLERY OF THE PALACE OF JUSTICE, TRUJILLO.]

According to colonial records, a small Spanish settlement already
existed on the site of the present city of Trujillo when Pizarro arrived
from Lima in 1535. Don Miguel de Estete, commissioned by Almagro the
year previous to find a suitable location for a town, had chosen this
place and settled a colony there. Pizarro approved and confirmed the
settlement already established, and formally founded the city of
Trujillo, giving it the name of his native town in Spain. The
Intendencia of Trujillo was defined at the same time to cover, not only
the present Department of La Libertad, but those of Lambayeque, Piura,
Cajamarca, and Amazonas. In 1537, the title of city was conferred on
Trujillo under the royal seal of the Emperor Charles V. and his mother,
the Queen Joana, and from the earliest days of its history the
municipality has been honored with the dignity of “Very Illustrious
Corporation of the City of Trujillo.” Throughout the period of the
viceroyalty, it was one of the most important centres of colonial
industry; many noble families had their estates in its fertile valleys,
and their descendants still retain possession. The people of Trujillo
are very proud of their ancestry, and conserve the courtly manner and
inherent grace distinctive of old Castile. Peruvians enjoy repeating, at
the expense of this hidalgo spirit, the humorous saying that “the bones
of Don Quixote lie interred in the Plaza of Trujillo.” There is an
atmosphere of refinement in the social life of the place that is as
charming as it is simple and genuine. Pride of race has proved no
disadvantage to Trujillo, whose people have other claims than heredity
on which to rest their merits.

[Illustration: CALLE DEL COMERCIO, TRUJILLO.]

Trujillo was the first city of Peru that proclaimed and took the oath of
Independence, on the 22d of December, 1820, the Cabildo being convened
under the presidency of the Intendente, the Marquis of Torre-Tagle.
General Bolivar, in his message to Congress in 1825, said that the
provinces comprising the Intendencia of Trujillo had given liberty to
Peru; and in recognition of this patriotic movement, he bestowed the
name of La Libertad on the Department, which, under the republic,
replaced the Intendencia of the colonial government. Later, the limits
of La Libertad were encroached upon to form the Departments of Amazonas,
Cajamarca, Piura, and Lambayeque, each of these divisions being entitled
to share the honor of having led the way to national liberty. In 1824,
Trujillo was declared the capital of the republic, during the time that
Lima was occupied by the royalists. Its history as a republican city
reflects honor on the people, who have shown their patriotism and
courage upon every occasion when the needs of the country have called
them to action. In the war with Chile, the Trujillo regiment was
distinguished among all the troops of Peru for bravery on the field;
from this city most liberal contributions have been made for purposes of
national defence; and the public spirit of the citizens is constantly
shown by their generous encouragement of enterprises for the public
benefit, such as the installation of the water works system, the paving
of sidewalks, and the maintenance of public parks and buildings, all of
which have been effected through the coöperation of progressive
townspeople.

[Illustration: PICTURESQUE ROAD THROUGH A SUGAR ESTATE.]

During the viceroyalty, Trujillo was a walled city, of oval form, and
about two leagues in circumference; the attacks of pirates led the Duke
de la Palata, when viceroy of Peru, to provide this means of defence
against invasion, the wall being built in 1617, of adobe, five feet
thick and ten feet high, with a parapet above it and fifteen bastions.
Only a few traces of this structure still remain, the increased
population and industrial development having extended the city’s
boundaries greatly beyond its former limits. The present population is
about twenty thousand. The streets follow the usual plan of
Spanish-built cities, cutting each other at right angles and having an
average width of from forty to fifty feet. The houses are of the Spanish
colonial style, in appearance resembling those of Lima more than any
other Peruvian city. Everywhere one sees the little balconies encased in
ornamental _rejas_ or barred frames; spacious _patios_, paved with
ornamental tiles and adorned with plants and flowers,—presenting a most
attractive appearance as seen from the street,—and solid walls and
massive doors, telling of a period when durability was deemed as
important as architectural beauty. The houses built nowadays are mere
shells in comparison with the edifices constructed by the Spanish
conquerors and their successors, when a wall had to be made several feet
thick to be satisfactory, and a door must be large enough to admit a
mounted horseman, and massive enough to resist a battering-ram. From the
principal public square, called here, as elsewhere in Spanish-America,
the Plaza de Armas, the most important public buildings may be seen, the
Prefecture, municipal buildings and other government offices overlooking
this central _paseo_. The plaza covers five acres and is ornamented with
a garden of shrubs and flowers, in the midst of which stands a large
stone fountain. Beautiful shade trees border the great square, making it
an ideal place for a promenade, and here the social world congregates in
the evening. In the vicinity of the plaza are several interesting old
churches of the colonial period. When Pizarro founded the city, the
chronicler of that event tells us, “the convents of Santo Domingo, San
Francisco, and La Merced were the corner stones of that enterprise.” The
convent of San Agustin, situated a block away from the plaza, was
founded in 1558, and the first Jesuit college in 1627. The episcopal
diocese of Trujillo was created in 1577.

[Illustration: A CORRAL ON A SUGAR ESTATE, CHICAMA VALLEY.]

The church of San Agustin is particularly notable for the magnificent
carving of its main altar and pulpit, and the rich gilding that adorns
them. The Jesuit college building has been occupied by the University of
Trujillo since the inauguration of the republic, in accordance with a
decree of President Bolivar, dated the 10th of May, 1824. The convent of
Belem, founded in 1671, is now used as a hospital. The schools and
benevolent institutions of Trujillo receive especial attention, and the
best interests of both are made a subject of public and private
consideration. Besides the University and the National College of San
Juan, maintained by the government, the Institute Moderno, the Colegio
de La Independencia and other schools afford secondary instruction, and
primary training is given in ten or more municipal colleges.

The night schools of Trujillo are worthy of emulation in every city of
Peru. Not only is manual training given, but lessons in bookkeeping,
etc., are taught, and classes are instructed in the English language,
which is regarded as of especial importance because of its usefulness in
a commercial career. The Railway Society of Mutual Protection, the
Employés’ Union of the Department of La Libertad and similar societies
are doing a great work for the improvement of conditions among the
clerks and other working people of the capital. Not only are classes
formed for the benefit of men who wish to pursue a special study, but
free instruction is given to boys who would otherwise be spending their
evenings in idle company on the streets. It is interesting to visit
these schools and see them filled night after night with eager and
ambitious pupils. The teachers give their services free during certain
evenings each week.

Trujillo has a theatre, a hippodrome, and social clubs, the Club de La
Libertad being an important organization which directs the amusements
and festivals held every season in the Park of La Libertad, the most
beautiful _paseo_ of Trujillo, and one of the finest parks in Peru. The
Central Club, the leading social organization of the city, counts among
its members many prominent men of the department. The press is
represented by three daily newspapers—of which _La Industria_ is the
largest—and a number of monthly periodicals. _The Torch_ and _The
Shoemaker_, both labor journals, are an expression of the interest taken
by the workingmen in the affairs of the day. A novel enterprise is the
publication of an illustrated almanac of three hundred pages, called _El
Mercurio_, devoted to a description of the Department of La Libertad,
its history, government, schools, and industrial development, and issued
at the publisher’s cost, in the interests of his commercial house and as
a propaganda of the department.

Two widely different attractions claim the attention of all visitors to
Trujillo,—the wonderful archæological ruins and the famous Chicama
Valley. Between the city and the sea extend the crumbling walls of
Chan-Chan and the Huacas of Moche, while northward, after a railway
journey of less than an hour, the traveller enters the blooming gardens
and green-mantled fields of a country overflowing with the bounties of a
perennial harvest. Chan-Chan covers a desert tract about fifty square
miles in circumference less than a league north of the capital, and just
beyond the little Indian village of Mansiche, on the road to the seaport
Huanchaco. It is said that rich treasure lies buried somewhere under the
modest little cluster of huts named Mansiche in honor of a great cacique
of the place. But one hears constantly of buried treasure in Trujillo.
The _peje chica_ and the _peje grande_—“little fish” and the “big
fish”—are magic words to those who understand. Every traveller who
possesses an imagination susceptible to the influence of mystery and
tradition must succumb to the glittering charm of the _peje chica_, and
feel the gold-hunter’s enthusiasm when brought into the realm of the
_peje grande_. As the horses jog along the road that leads from the city
to the ruins, visions of hidden treasure throw a glamour over the most
commonplace scenes, and every mound by the roadside is an object of
curiosity as a possible repository for treasure. It is a matter of
history that soon after the Conquest a vast fortune was unearthed at
Chan-Chan, of which the king’s fifth amounted to a million dollars in
value, this treasure being known as the _peje chica_. One version of the
story tells that the cacique of Mansiche, who had observed with
particular attention the kindness of a young Spaniard toward the people
of the conquered race, and had noticed also that he was very poor,
revealed the secret of the hiding-place of the _peje chica_, on
condition that a portion of the wealth should be used to advance the
interests of the Indians. The most valuable article discovered was in
the form of a fish, of solid gold, and so large that the Spaniards
considered it a rare prize; but the cacique assured his young friend
that it was only the “little fish” and that a much greater treasure
existed in the “big fish,” worth many times the value of this one. The
sequel to the story is that the Spaniard forgot his promise, went off to
Spain and spent all his gold, and was returning to get the _peje
grande_, of which he made great boasts, when he was thrown from his
horse and killed. From that day to the present, treasure hunters have
dug into the _huacas_ of Chan-Chan and Moche with faith and
persistence,—but without finding the _peje grande_. Many interesting
relics of the ancient civilization have been unearthed, and the present
prefect of Trujillo, Dr. Carlos Velarde, has accomplished a notable work
in the excavation of the great wall of Chan-Chan, covered with carvings
of fishes, turtles, pelicans, and other animals of the seashore. Dr. Max
Uhle is now engaged in making excavations at Chan-Chan and at Moche, the
latter offering a study of much archæological importance in its “Huaco
del Sol.”

[Illustration: A LOAD OF CANE READY FOR THE FACTORY.]

[Illustration: MAIN ENTRANCE TO A SUGAR HACIENDA NEAR TRUJILLO.]

Moche is an Indian town situated midway between Trujillo and the port of
Salaverry, to the south. Its inhabitants preserve their primitive
costumes, and wear a distinctive dress, the women’s garb consisting of a
chemise and a single piece of dark blue cloth wrapped round the body and
fastened at the waist, reaching to the ankles. The municipal ordinance
forbids the wearing of this costume in the city, but at Moche it is
everywhere seen. The Moche Indians never intermarry with other races,
and they are as proud of their unmixed pedigree as any “belted earl.”
They are an intelligent people, and the women are graceful and
ready-witted. Recently, two North American ladies were being shown the
sights of Trujillo, when their cicerone drew attention to a Moche girl
riding by on a donkey, evidently on her way to Moche. Seeing that she
was an object of interest, she smiled and bowed with the nonchalance of
a court belle, and asked the ladies’ escort, “_Gringas?_” As the
amusement of the strangers told that they understood this patronymic to
apply to themselves, she hastened to add, hospitably, “Bring them to
Moche!”

It is impossible to imagine a more complete transition than is made when
one leaves the enchanted realm of the _peje grande_ for the varying
sights and scenes of the Chicama valley. It is necessary to visit the
former in order to appreciate the full significance of the latter.
Everything around Chan-Chan is a temptation to live on dreams, to try
one’s luck at treasure hunting, or to dig _huacas_ in the hope of
getting a rare specimen for some archæological museum. The Chicama
valley affords proof that there are richer treasures in its fertile
fields than Chan-Chan ever had in hiding, and no uncertainty exists as
to their location. Its area is about a hundred square leagues, drained
by the Chicama River, which rises in the province of Otuzco, Department
of La Libertad, and flows into the Pacific. On its great plantations,
sugar-cane is grown that reaches a height of from twenty to twenty-five
feet, containing more than fourteen per cent of sugar. The broad estates
of Casa Grande, Roma, Cartavio, and others, are crossed by private
railways which carry the cane from the fields to the mills; and the
entire valley has direct communication with the port of Salaverry by
means of the state railway, now under the administration of the Peruvian
Corporation. From the port, the main line passes through Moche, Trujillo
(eight miles from Salaverry), and crossing the desert _pampa_ with one
stop only at the station of La Cumbre, enters the valley at the town of
Chicama, twenty miles north of the capital. About a mile above this
point, after passing Chiclín, the train crosses an immense iron bridge,
about three thousand feet long, over the Chicama River. The route then
lies entirely through the district of the sugar lands, the principal
stations being Chocope, Constancia Junction, Casa Grande Junction,
Facalá, and the terminal station of Ascope, fifty miles from Salaverry.
From all these stations, private railways connect with the sugar
plantations. The Hacienda of Roma is connected directly with the port of
Huanchaco by a private line, making an extension of thirty-five miles.
This immense property, like the estates of Casa Grande and Cartavio,
embraces many thousands of acres and supports large communities of
working people. Life presents a very pleasant picture on these large
plantations, where a good climate, healthful labor, comfortable homes
and ample provision for their needs contribute to make the employés
contented and happy. Churches, schools, and hospitals are provided, and
on some plantations there are free libraries, and night classes are
taught for the benefit of those who work during the day. Telephones
connect the haciendas with Trujillo, and, as most of them are situated
within a couple of hours’ ride by railway from that city, constant
communication is maintained. The Casa Grande Company owns one of the
most important sugar estates of the Chicama valley, covering nearly two
hundred thousand acres of land, and supports a population of about five
thousand, most of the number living in the vicinity of Casa Grande. The
machinery used in the sugar factory of this hacienda is of the most
modern manufacture, equal to the best in existence for the purpose.
Electricity is used for lighting, the hacienda having a dynamo for two
hundred lights of sixteen candle-power and a motor of twenty-five
horse-power. The new system of crushing and elaborating the cane in the
factory of Casa Grande is so complete that the process follows
automatically from the unloading of the cars as they arrive from the
fields, to the filling of the sacks with sugar, ready for market. Not
only in the factory, but in the fields, modern machinery is used, and
agricultural implements of the best manufacture are employed. This is
true of Roma and Cartavio as well as Casa Grande. The resident managers
of these haciendas enjoy every comfort that a well-ordered establishment
can provide, and they entertain with generous hospitality.

[Illustration: THE CHAPEL OF A HACIENDA AT GALINDO.]

Although the fame of the Chicama valley outshines that of other
sugar-growing districts of Trujillo, there are large and rich
plantations also in the valleys of Jequetepeque, or Pacasmayo, to the
north, and in Santa Catalina and Moche to the south. A railway connects
the seaport of Pacasmayo with the sugar lands and rice fields of the
interior, extending fifty miles to Guadalupe and Yonan, on the road to
Cajamarca. The province of Pacasmayo, which adjoins that of Trujillo,
has about five thousand acres under cultivation in sugar-cane, and its
rice harvest yields one hundred thousand sacks annually. The valleys of
Santa Catalina and Moche are connected with Trujillo by a branch of the
main railway from Salaverry, which extends from Trujillo to Laredo,
Galindo, and Menocucho, passing through plantations of sugar, rice, and
other products. The annual exports of sugar from the port of Salaverry
amount to about fifty thousand tons and those from Huanchaco average
between twenty-five thousand and thirty thousand tons. An important
share of these shipments goes to North American ports.

[Illustration: PARK OF LA LIBERTAD, TRUJILLO.]

The Department of La Libertad is composed of six provinces, those of
Trujillo and Pacasmayo bordering the Pacific Ocean, while the remaining
four—Otuzco, Santiago de Chuco, Huamachuco, and Pataz—are situated in
the region of the sierra. The Marañon River divides the province of
Huamachuco from that of Pataz, and in its lower valleys the climate of
the Montaña prevails, coffee, sugar, and cacao being produced. Coca is
one of the important products of this department, and cocaine is
manufactured in Trujillo for shipment to foreign ports. On the high
_puna_, abundant pasture is found, and, in the lower sierra, wheat,
barley, maize, and potatoes are cultivated. The southern districts of
the province of Trujillo contain saline deposits of importance.

[Illustration: ADMINISTRATION HOUSE OF A SUGAR ESTATE IN THE CHICAMA
VALLEY.]

Not only is the Department of La Libertad rich in agricultural products
of every zone, but the mines of its sierras abound in precious metals.
For the past few years, especial interest has been taken in the mineral
wealth of this region, small lots of gold, silver, and copper ores being
exported with most satisfactory returns. Quiruvilca, sixty-six miles
beyond the terminus of the railway which connects Trujillo with
Menocucho, is a mining district covering about a hundred square miles
rich in copper and silver. Veins having an average width of fourteen
inches contain from fifty to sixty per cent copper, and silver veins of
sixteen inches in width produce as much as a thousand ounces of silver.
The Quiruvilca mine is two days’ ride on muleback from the end of the
railway, which is twenty-seven miles from the port of Salaverry, where
all the steamers of the west coast call for cargo. Although the property
has not been developed on the large scale necessary to make it a famous
copper mine, it is worked successfully and yields good returns for the
small capital employed. Two hundred tons can now be exported daily, the
high and low grade ores together averaging forty-five per cent copper.
It is the purpose of the present owners, who are also the chief
proprietors of Casa Grande, to place this enterprise on a gigantic
basis, by constructing a railway, not only to Quiruvilca, but to another
mine, Araqueda, also enormously rich in copper and silver, and by
establishing smelting works and other improvements for which large
capital must be employed. The easy accessibility to a good port and the
mildness of the climate of this mining region, as compared with the
severity of the _puna_ where many of the most valuable mines of Peru are
located, are strong points in favor of its rapid development.

The subjects of the Incas worked the mines of the sierra throughout this
region and had thriving villages in the various mountain districts of
the present Department of La Libertad. The town of Huamachuco, now the
capital of the province of the same name, was a populous Indian
settlement at the time of the Conquest, when Hernando Pizarro discovered
it while leading his army southward from Piura in search of the treasure
which Atahuallpa had said would be found in the temple of Pachacámac.
The Conquerors were too intent on collecting the gold and silver of the
Inca’s palaces and temples to occupy themselves at that time with the
question of mining and of the wealth to be gained by such a laborious
process; they saw the coveted metal within their reach without having to
dig for it, and they little guessed the hidden treasures over which they
marched on their way to plunder the sacred halls of Pachacámac. Perhaps
the source of the rich gold and silver ornaments of the Chimus is to be
found in the sierras of Otuzco, Santiago de Chuco, Pataz, and
Huamachuco, the fountain-head of that precious stream down which the
_peje grande_ floated to lose itself among the _huacas_ of Chan-Chan and
Moche.

                             CHAPTER XXIII
                       THE COTTON FIELDS OF PIURA


[Illustration: A COTTON PLANT ON A PIURA PLANTATION.]

When Pizarro chose the valley of Piura as the site on which to found the
first Spanish city in Peru, he was especially attracted by its fertility
and the abundance of water that supplied its flourishing farms and
gardens. Agriculture was highly developed by the ancient inhabitants of
this region, and cotton, which is the staple product of Piura to-day,
was grown in the coast valleys centuries before the Spaniards visited
these shores. Cotton materials have been found in the tombs of the
people who ruled throughout this part of Peru before the Incas gained
ascendancy, and the use of the product seems to have been known here
from time immemorial. No doubt Pizarro and his followers passed through
fields of cotton on their way from Tumbes to Piura, as the Conqueror
gave an enthusiastic report of the prosperous farming communities seen
during his march.

The founding of Piura preceded that of Lima by three years, and in
recognition of its having been the first Spanish city in Peru, the
sovereigns conferred on it the distinction of a coat-of-arms before that
honor was bestowed on Quito. During the colonial period, Piura grew to
be a centre of industrial activity, and under the republic it has become
the flourishing capital of one of the richest departments of the coast.
The city has several churches, good schools, and charitable
institutions. Its citizens are progressive and are interested in the
advancement of education and the improvement of material conditions. The
Department of Piura, which shares with that of La Libertad the honors
due to a patriotic and courageous people, was made an independent
Littoral Province in 1837, and a department in 1861. Through the varying
experiences of the republic, this department has borne an honorable
share of the burdens and the triumphs, and some of the most
distinguished men of Peru have learned their earliest lessons in
patriotism under the training of its worthy matrons. The immortal hero,
Admiral Grau, was born in Piura; and after this revered name follow
those of statesmen and men of letters who rank with the best in their
country.

[Illustration: A BUSY THOROUGHFARE OF CATACAOS.]

The Department of Piura lies in the extreme north of the coast region,
separated from the gulf of Guayaquil by the Littoral Province of Tumbes.
It is divided into the coast provinces of Paita and Piura and the
interior provinces of Ayabaca and Huancabamba. Paita is drained by the
Chira River, which rises in the Cordilleras and crosses the southern
districts of the province, fertilizing some of the most extensive
plantations of northern Peru. The Piura River traverses the province of
the same name, and in its winding course,—first northwestward, and then
south and southwest,—it supplies irrigation to all the west and north of
Piura province. The river is crossed by several bridges, the most
important being that of the capital, a handsome iron structure. In the
region fertilized by these two rivers are grown some of the finest
qualities of cotton to be found on the globe, the “Peruvian” ranking
next to the famous “Sea Island” in the European market. The territory
under irrigation extends westward from the seaport of Paita along the
northern bank of the Chira River to the foot of the Cordilleras, and
from the port of Sechura to Piura, in the valley of the Piura
River,—though the Piura valley is irrigated at intervals throughout its
whole length. According to scientific authorities who have reported
officially on the possibility of increasing the extent of cultivable
territory on the coast, this fertile zone does not represent half the
area of irrigable lands in the vicinity of these rivers; nor does it
yield all the harvest that might be gathered if it were entirely under
tillage.

The scarcity of laborers and the need of more capital in Piura, as
elsewhere in Peru, has caused much land to remain idle which is capable
of producing great wealth. But, as a noted authority on this industry,
Señor Victor Marie, says in his book, _Cotton Production in Peru_, there
is no reason why the laborers of the sierra should not be induced to
come to the coast, and, by kind treatment and judicious training, be
employed to serve the interests of its agriculture better than imported
labor. Señor Marie adds: “How much the country would gain by the
instruction and education of these strong sons of the sierra, a robust,
docile and laborious race, who need only to be well organized, and
guarded against the evils of alcoholism!” It is suggested that, if given
homes, with a little piece of land to cultivate as their own, and gently
treated, many families would gladly abandon their mountain farms for the
milder climate and more certain abundance of the coast. At present, the
laborers from the sierra who are employed on the haciendas of the coast,
work during only a part of the year, going back to the mountains as soon
as the harvest is gathered. They cannot be counted on to return every
season, nor is it at all certain how long they will remain. But, in
opposition to Señor Marie’s suggestion, it might be urged: “Why take the
mountaineer from his native soil, which is capable of cultivation far
beyond what it yields at present and is the favored zone for such
products as potatoes, maize, wheat, barley, and other cereals?” The
adoption of means toward better organization and the reduction of
alcoholism in the sierra, such as is recommended for the coast, might
result in the improvement of agricultural development in these mountain
districts, a consequence equally important to the country.

The richest cotton-growing region of Peru lies in the vicinity of
Sechura and Catacaos on the Piura River, and in the lower valley of the
Chira, where the lands have been formed by alluvial deposits and were
formerly covered with forests of mesquite, called _algarrobas_. Here the
Peruvian cotton attains its finest development and is so easily produced
that good lands require to be irrigated only once a season to ensure a
bountiful harvest. Sowing is a simple process which consists in dropping
the seed into holes ten or fifteen feet apart. It is not necessary to
plough the ground, and irrigation ditches carry from the Chira and Piura
Rivers all the water required for fertilization. In the spaces between
the cotton plants are grown melons, pumpkins, and the indispensable
maize. The first harvest appears eight months after the seed is sown,
though it is usually small, seldom amounting to more than four hundred
pounds to the acre. The production increases each year following, up to
the fifth or sixth year, when the crop reaches an average of more than
half a ton to the acre. On the plantations of Mancora and in the
beautiful chacaras of Monte Viejo, Los Dos Altos, Cumbivira, Chato, Casa
Grande, Monte Negro, and others, the Peruvian cotton grows to
perfection. In the valley of the Chira, where there is the greatest
abundance of water and the only problem presented to the cotton-grower
is how to make the best use of it for irrigation, the future of this
industry offers brilliant prospects. Within the past few years its
cultivable lands have been greatly increased, especially in the
_campiñas_ of Sullana and Querecotillo, and on the San Francisco,
Chocán, Mallares, Saman and other haciendas.

[Illustration: ALGARROBA TREES ON A PIURA PLANTATION.]

Much of the material that is sold in foreign markets as pure woollen is
made of Peruvian cotton, which is of a very rough fibre measuring from
one to two inches in length. On the plantations near the coast the
cotton is rougher than in the interior, and is called in English markets
Full Rough Peruvian, the most valuable of all the native fibres. When
carded it looks so much like wool that only an expert can tell the
difference; and after being woven into cloth, the distinction between
the two products can hardly be determined, except by chemical analysis.
For this reason Peruvian cotton has been called “vegetable wool,” and
has been used in the manufacture of materials to serve the same purpose
as the real wool.

The native cotton plant is a hardy shrub which, if allowed to reach its
full height, grows to from ten to fourteen feet, though the planter
usually prunes it down so that it does not exceed six or seven feet in
height. The Peruvian cotton plant will live twenty years, and will bear
its harvest crop after four or five years’ growth. It is the custom,
however, to sow fresh seed every three or four years, as, when the plant
becomes old, its harvest grows lighter each year and it is liable to
“blight,” or to the attacks of parasites. The cotton fields of Piura are
generally free from the ravages of insects, the only annoyance of this
kind being a visitation of the _arrebiatado_, an insect which appears
chiefly in the rainy season. As rain falls only once or twice in a dozen
years, this evil is a minor one. Besides, the _arrebiatado_ does not
attack all varieties, the Egyptian, or Upland, as it is known in the
United States, being free from its onslaughts.

The cotton-pickers on Piura plantations find occupation at all seasons
of the year, though two principal harvests are gathered, those of St.
John’s Day and Christmas; the former lasts from June to October and the
latter from December to March. Men, women, and children may be seen in
the cotton fields filling their sacks in the shade of the bush, which at
harvest time is thick with leaves and tall enough to afford abundant
shelter. Here and there are groups enjoying a little gossip as they pass
one another on their way to and from the field. At the various stations
along the railway, the scene is not unlike that which is met with
wherever the cotton plant flourishes. The pickers of these valleys are
less joyous and garrulous than are the negroes of a Mississippi or
Georgia plantation,—the melodies of Dixie are more musical than the
_tristes_ of these less volatile laborers,—but there is always the charm
of tropical skies and luxuriant nature to brighten their faces with a
smile of good-humored content.

[Illustration: IRON BRIDGE OVER THE PIURA RIVER.]

When the cotton is ready for market, it is loaded on donkeys and sent to
the nearest railway station to be shipped. As the donkey’s load must not
exceed three hundred and sixty pounds, it is customary to have the
cotton put up in bales of from one hundred and sixty to one hundred and
eighty pounds, two bales being a full load for one of these carriers. In
Piura, Sechura, Catacaos, and in various towns of the Chira valley, the
large importing houses of Peru have purchasing agencies, and these
establishments are equipped with cotton gins and presses for cleansing
the fibre and preparing it for transportation. The cotton seed is nearly
all exported to Europe, where it is sold for five or six pounds sterling
per ton. The prices of cotton vary according to the harvest, and to the
prices current in the world’s market, though the cotton of the Piura
valley is sold always for upward of eight cents, gold, per pound. The
price has risen considerably within recent years and continues to
advance, as the product gains in favor in the markets abroad, especially
in New York, where Peruvian cotton is constantly growing in demand.

[Illustration: THE MARKET PLACE AT CATACAOS.]

Although the native cotton commands the highest price, and is cultivated
with least labor on the plantations of Piura, yet the Egyptian variety
also yields good returns for the capital and labor invested, and its
culture constitutes an important source of revenue to the state. The
Egyptian grows to a height of about four feet and under favorable
conditions lives three or four years. It has an abundant foliage, with
blossoms that deepen from a pale yellow to red as they grow into full
bloom. The cotton boll is formed of five carpels, or leaves, and the
fruit, when it bursts forth from this enclosure, is white and smooth, in
contrast to the Peruvian, which is of a pink color, and, as already
stated, extremely rough. The culture of Egyptian cotton has increased in
favor within recent years, in consequence of the advanced prices in
foreign markets. In Mallares and Saman, especially, this variety is
produced with important results. One of the advantages which it enjoys
is freedom from the “blight,” which at times invades other varieties,
and the fact that the _arrebiatado_ does not attack it. Also, the
Egyptian yields a harvest six months after planting, so that it is
comparatively easy to secure credit for the outlays necessary to produce
the crop. In the cultivation of this variety, it is necessary to
irrigate the land several times during the season, but it flourishes
with little labor, and is easily harvested.

A railway, sixty miles in length, connects the cotton-growing centres
with the chief seaport of the department, Paita, where all the vessels
engaged in trade on the west coast of South America make regular calls.
The harbor is visited several times a week by passenger and cargo
steamers of English, North American, German, and South American lines
and by sailing ships flying the flags of all nations. Here the cotton
bales are transferred from the freight car to the ship’s hold to be
carried to foreign ports; and Paita presents an animated scene while the
cargo is being loaded. The railway extends from the port northward till
it reaches the Chira valley, which it ascends as far as Sullana, an
important cotton market, after which it turns southward, following the
valley of the Piura to the state capital and, five miles beyond, to
Catacaos, in the heart of the cotton region. Along its route are many
thriving towns and villages, which owe their existence chiefly to the
cotton industry, though this is by no means the only important product
of the department.

Panamá hats—which are not made in Panamá at all, and which, in Ecuador
and Peru, where this industry flourishes, are called _jipi-japa_
(pronounced “hippy-happa”), from the name of the fibre used in their
manufacture—are made in Catacaos. The finest hats are woven with great
care, the fibre being kept under water during the process and never
exposed to the sun until the hat is finished. On all the passenger
steamers that call at Paita, venders of these hats may be seen
bargaining with travellers, and the sales amount to large sums, as the
most ordinary Panamá hat, when purchased from the weavers themselves,
costs at least a pound sterling. The imitation of this article has been
so successfully manufactured that the trade is greatly injured thereby,
though it is said, on the other hand, that the genuine _jipi-japa_ is
increasing in value, owing to its scarcity on the market.

Like other coast departments, Piura extends inland to the valleys of the
Amazon headwaters, and includes in its territory not only the cotton
fields of the coast, but the mines of the sierra, the pastures of the
uplands, and the coffee, tobacco, and sugar-cane of the Montaña. The
province of Ayabaca has gold mines, forests in which the valuable
Peruvian bark is found, pastures for cattle and sheep, and plantations
of coffee and sugar-cane. In the district of Frias, every town is a rose
garden, and bee-keeping is a flourishing industry. Huancabamba is a rich
field for cattle-raising, and is especially noted for the superior wool
of its sheep, the fleece of which is black, long, and of silky texture.
In its lower valleys are cultivated tobacco, coffee, and sugar-cane. In
the provinces of Paita and Piura are vast saline fields, beds of
saltpetre, pitch deposits, and important petroleum wells.

With the completion of the proposed railway from Paita to the head of
navigation on the Marañon, by which communication will be established
between the extensive region of the Montaña and the Pacific coast, this
department will become one of the most important highways of traffic in
the republic. With its abundant resources and healthful climate, there
is every reason to expect great development in wealth and population. At
present the population of Piura, which covers a territory of about
fifteen thousand square miles, is a little more than two hundred
thousand.

                              CHAPTER XXIV
          VINEYARDS AND ORCHARDS OF THE SOUTHERN COAST REGION


[Illustration: SUBMARINE BLASTING OFF MOLLENDO.]

From Lima southward, the coast valleys resemble those of Southern
California, though no idea of their beauty and fertility is to be gained
from a view of the coast line, which here stretches along in the same
monotonous series of sandhills and barren cliffs that mark its length
all the way from Guayaquil to Valparaiso, with only a few green spots,
as at Callao and Arica, to brighten its sombre aspect. Travellers find
it hard to believe that abundance and fertility belong to a region
apparently so little favored, but, to be convinced, it is necessary only
to disembark at one of the ports in the vicinity of these valleys and to
make a half-hour’s trip into the interior by railway. At some of the
ports, the green vineyards and gardens run so close to the shore that
only a narrow strip of sand lies between. This desert strip once
crossed, the scene is changed completely, and nature appears radiant and
smiling in the midst of winding streams and verdant fields.

The vineyards of Peru are still in the early stages of development,
though wine-growing has been an industry of the country for centuries,
the first cuttings having been introduced as early as 1557 by
Carabantes, when experiments were made in viticulture in several
districts of the coast. The valleys and hillsides of Ica and Moquegua
were found to be especially adapted for this industry, though the
vineyards of Lima, Arequipa and Tacna also yield good harvests.
Wine-growing has received more attention within recent years than
formerly, and the results are apparent in the increased quantity and
improved quality of the production. In the Department of Ica, the most
promising vineyards are located in the vicinity of the capital and in
the _campiña_ around Chincha Alta, near the port of Tambo de Mora, about
a hundred miles south of Callao.

[Illustration: MOQUEGUA, A WINE-GROWING CENTRE OF THE SOUTHERN COAST
REGION.]

Ica was formerly a province of the Department of Lima, and was made
independent in 1855, being raised to the dignity of a department in
1868. It comprises the three provinces of Ica, Pisco, and Chincha, all
of which border on the Pacific Ocean and are almost entirely within the
coast zone, with the exception of the province of Ica, that extends to
the region of the sierra on the border of Ayacucho and Huancavelica.
This department, like all the others of the coast, has a large area of
uncultivated land which is irrigable and should be immensely productive.
Four rivers cross the department,—the Chincha, Pisco, Ica and
Grande,—each receiving a number of tributaries, with a water supply
sufficient to fertilize all their valleys, if scientifically controlled
and utilized. The ancient inhabitants knew how to irrigate these lands,
and the ruins of their aqueducts may still be seen in various districts.
On the Pisco River, about thirty miles from its mouth, a waterfall
occurs, which could easily supply a hundred thousand horse-power for
engineering purposes. A few miles from the city of Ica, the capital of
the department, are situated the lakes of Huacachina and Cachiche,
famous for their therapeutic properties. Huacachina is a favorite resort
for invalids, the mild climate and picturesque locality contributing to
make it popular, while the curative effects of its waters, strongly
impregnated with iodine, are remarkable. The city of Ica, having a
population of about ten thousand, lies in the centre of a large and
fertile valley and in the midst of flourishing vineyards and cotton
plantations.

The cultivated area of the Ica valley is estimated at forty thousand
acres, of which one-fifth is covered with vineyards. The wine-growing
district extends along the valley from Huamani, about twenty miles north
of the capital, to Ocucaje, thirty miles to the south. Ica is the
paradise of the farmer of small means, there being few large haciendas
in the valley, with the exception of those of Ocucaje, comprising six
thousand acres, and Macacona, with about four thousand acres. Many
vineyards cover no more than about ten or fifteen acres, and, as a rule,
the haciendas comprise only from one hundred to two hundred acres. Each
hacienda has its vineyard, though, at the same time, a part of the land
is devoted to the cultivation of cotton, maize, and tropical fruits,
such as chirimoyas (custard apples), mangoes, plantains, melons, paltas
(alligator pears), and figs; on these plantations are also cultivated
vegetables of various kinds,—squash, camotes (a kind of potato), yucca,
cucumbers, etc.,—and on the uplands grow alfalfa, aji (a kind of
pepper), and wheat.

[Illustration: THE LANDING PIER OF THE PORT OF PISCO.]

The principal varieties of grapes cultivated in the vineyards of Ica are
the Quebranta, Moscatel, Negra, and Moyar, for red wines; and the
Albilla and Italia, white varieties; though there is also a pink Italia
grape, of rich flavor, a delicious table fruit. The Italia produces a
liqueur of fine quality; and Peruvian “Pisco” is well known throughout
the west coast of South America, its name being derived from the port at
which the earliest shipments were made. The Moscatel is used in the
manufacture of a very palatable Sauterne, and the Negra produces a good
claret. The most prolific vines are those of the Quebranta variety, the
grapes of which are rich in sugar; this vine is grown in nearly all the
vineyards of Peru. Ica is connected with the seaport of Pisco by
railway, the line extending for forty miles, in a northwesterly
direction, across the Pampa of Chuncanga. As the train enters this sandy
plain an hour after leaving the capital, there is little to charm the
traveller in the monotonous view; but the country to the north of Pisco,
between that port and Chincha Alta, fifteen miles distant, presents a
different aspect, showing fields of sugar-cane and flourishing
vineyards.

[Illustration: AVENUE OF WILLOW TREES ON A SOUTHERN COAST HACIENDA.]

[Illustration: HARVESTING ALFALFA ON THE FRISCO HACIENDA, NEAR
MOLLENDO.]

The principal estates of the Chincha valley are situated within a few
miles of the port of Tambo de Mora, which is connected with Chincha Alta
by a railway seven miles in length. This region, enclosing one of the
most prosperous industrial centres of Peru, is drained by the Chincha
River, a short, broad stream that has its source in the sierra of
Huancavelica, receiving only a few tributaries as it crosses the
province to the sea, where it divides and forms a delta; in this
low-lying district are the towns of Chincha Alta, Chincha Baja, Suñampe,
and Tambo de Mora, as well as the extensive haciendas of Larán (nine
thousand acres), San José, San Regis, El Carmen, Hoja Redonda, and Lurin
Chincha. Irrigating ditches, or acequias, have been constructed to
convey water from the river through all these estates, the distribution
being made under the direction of a water inspector employed by the
government. In addition to the acequias, every plantation has its wells,
which furnish plenty of water, even in the dryest seasons. Chincha Alta
has the most extensive and best equipped wine-growing establishments in
Peru. Modern methods are employed in cultivating the grapes as well as
in the pressing, fermentation, and other details connected with the
wine-making process. The cuttings are planted in September, in holes
about three feet deep and eight feet apart, one shoot being placed in
each; during the first two or three years, the young vine is supported
on stakes of wild cane, then square columns of adobe, about four feet
high, are put up at intervals, to serve as supports for trellises built
of Guayaquil bamboo and willow, over which the vines spread in rich
profusion. Within ten or twelve years the whole space is covered,
forming a dense bower. The average harvest of grapes in this country
gives nine hundred gallons of wine to the acre, but in prosperous years
the yield is much heavier.

[Illustration: SCENE ON A POULTRY FARM IN SOUTHERN AREQUIPA.]

It was not until about thirty years ago that the manufacture of wine was
undertaken in Peru according to European methods. Up to that time every
wine-grower had his own little establishment, with a primitive wine
press, etc., and kept his jugs of wine in small cellars built for the
purpose. A few of these bodegas remain at the present time, but their
number grows less and less as the larger establishments buy up the
product of the small vineyards at a better price than the owner can get
by making the wine himself. The largest wine bodega in Peru is located
in Chincha; it produces about four hundred thousand gallons annually.
The total output of the province far exceeds that of any other wine
district in the republic, Pisco coming second and Moquegua third. The
entire yield of Peruvian vineyards is estimated at seven million gallons
of wine and three hundred thousand gallons of spirits.

Pisco, the chief seaport of the Department of Ica and one of the most
important of the southern coast, exports not only the wine and other
products of its own department, but is the outlet for the neighboring
states of Huancavelica and Ayacucho. It is one of the oldest ports of
Peru, having been founded in the seventeenth century. The annual exports
from Pisco amount in value to a million dollars gold, and its imports to
half that amount, though the wines of Ica do not represent the largest
share of the revenue of the port, appearing as the minor articles of
commerce.

Although the vineyards of Moquegua have not been cultivated so
extensively as those of Chincha and Ica, its olive groves rival the best
of other sections, and all kinds of fruits grow in its orchards and
fields. The olives of Moquegua are particularly remarkable for their
size, richness, and quality, equalling the best varieties produced in
Seville and California. This fruit was first imported into Peru from
Seville, Spain, during the time of the viceroyalty, and became perfectly
acclimatized, producing a better olive in its new home than in the
parent orchard, though the cultivation was neglected in consequence of
the repeated gold, silver, and copper “finds” that absorbed the
attention of the people in those days; and it is only within recent
years that the industry has assumed importance. In the coast province of
Camaná, Department of Arequipa, and in Ilo and Moquegua, the olive
groves extend over many acres; and, although the industry is still in
its infancy and only the most primitive methods are used in the
elaboration of the fruit, the yield is thirty per cent of pure oil. At
present, the production of olives does not amount to sufficient for the
home market, and very little is exported.

A favorite diversion of passengers on the steamers making the voyage
along the west coast of South America is to watch the loading of the
ships in the various ports. At some of these ports baskets of dried figs
and dates are brought on board by the local venders; but, though this is
a promising trade, it is still in a primitive stage of development. The
province of Ica has a few establishments where dried fruits and jams are
prepared, and every year shows an improvement in the industry.

[Illustration: A MILK VENDER ON HER WAY TO MARKET.]

[Illustration: THE SAMA VALLEY, TACNA.]




                              CHAPTER XXV
                            TACNA AND ARICA


[Illustration: A VENERABLE PALM OF TACNA.]

At the time of the Independence, Arica was a province of Arequipa, which
then comprised, in addition to its present territory, the provinces of
Moquegua, Arica, and Tarapacá. Afterward Arica was divided to create the
province of Tacna, and, in 1839, Moquegua was separated from Arequipa
and joined to Tacna, Arica, and Tarapacá, to form the Department of
Moquegua. In 1868, Tarapacá was made an independent Littoral Province,
with Iquique as its capital; and, in 1875, the province of Moquegua was
elevated to the same dignity. Tacna and Arica, with the small province
of Tarata, which had been formed the year previous by a division of
Tacna, were then joined to constitute the Department of Tacna, one of
the richest and most important of the republic, politically and
commercially.

In Arica, as well as Tarapacá, nitrate exists in large quantities; and
this product, the exports of which had already, in 1875, reached a
quarter of a million tons annually, was then rapidly making Tarapacá the
richest province of Peru, and its capital, Iquique, a flourishing centre
of commercial prosperity. When war brought disaster to the country a few
years later, and the indemnity demanded by Chile meant the dismemberment
of the republic, the Littoral Province of Tarapacá, ceded
unconditionally, became a part of Chile at the same time that Tacna and
Arica passed into the temporary possession of that country, in
accordance with the treaty of Ancón, in 1883.

Thus, by the mere accident of being a border province, Tarapacá—whose
people had fought for their country in all its battles; had been taught
from their cradles to worship the national heroes and to emulate their
patriotic deeds; had been among the first to join their
fellow-countrymen when a call to arms brought the nation into the field
against a common foe—Tarapacá, the victim of circumstances, was
condemned to recognize the government that had issued a declaration of
war against its people, and, in the hour of victory, had demanded its
territory as payment for the costs of war. The conquering nation made
what has been regarded by many as an exorbitant claim; but Chile acted
on precedent and within the law of nations. The deplorable fact is not
that a country should have taken the full measure of its reward for
victory, but that, after nearly two thousand years of Christianity, it
should still be permitted among Christian nations for one government to
demand, and another to grant, the dismemberment of a united nation,
whose sons have stood together as compatriots through all its
vicissitudes, have labored for its well-being and gloried in its
progress; and that they and their property should suddenly be placed
under foreign jurisdiction, because the decisions of a war council will
it so. It is believed by some pessimists that the dominion of military
force is as strong to-day as ever, and that only the necessity for
preserving “the balance of power” prevents wars of conquest in the
twentieth century as relentless as those of the fifteenth—but who, that
has seen the “Christ of the Andes,” or read the Constitution of the
United States, can believe this to be true?

[Illustration: BRIDGE ACROSS THE SAMA RIVER, PROVISIONAL BOUNDARY
BETWEEN PERU AND CHILE.]

As regards Tacna, the situation being temporary, or presumably so, one’s
sensibilities are not so afflicted by the condition. When the plebiscite
comes, a majority vote will suffice to give the Peruvians back their
ownership, on their government’s paying ten million dollars indemnity.
These provinces have always been closely identified with the political
life of Peru. It was from Tacna that the first band of patriots started
out to join the Independent forces on the plain of Oruro against the
royalist armies; and it was from this capital that the voice of the
grand old republican, Gonzales Vigil, sounded the first clarion notes of
appeal for liberal government in the newly organized councils of the
nation. Statesmen, scholars, and soldiers have come out of the homes of
Tacna and Arica to serve their government in the cabinet, the college,
and the battlefield. And the Morro de Arica, a perpetual monument to the
courage of Peruvian officers, serves ever to remind those who wait for
the promised plebiscite that their children must be told its history.

[Illustration: SNOW PEAKS ON THE BOLIVIAN BORDER, TACNA.]

By the terms of the treaty mentioned, the Sama River marks the northern
boundary of the territory occupied by Chile, which leaves a part of the
provinces of Tacna and Tarata under Peruvian government. The entire area
of these provinces is about fourteen thousand square miles, the
districts at present occupied by Chile covering three-fourths of the
territory. The Department of Tacna extends from the Pacific Ocean inland
to the Bolivian border, and is bounded on the north and northwest by the
Peruvian states of Puno and Moquegua. The coast region is warm and dry,
and the pampas of Arica are rich in nitrate deposits. The city of Arica,
situated on the beautiful bay of the same name, possesses one of the
most delightful climates in the world. It is the seaport terminus of the
Tacna and Arica railway, and the chief outlet for the traffic of a vast
territory. The new offices of the Arica and La Paz railway—which is now
under construction by Chile to connect the Bolivian city with this
seaport—occupy a handsome building overlooking the harbor, and the city
has several attractive public edifices, parks, and plazas. Tacna is the
social and educational centre of the department, and its capital; though
under the existing conditions, the centre of Peruvian government is
established at Locumba, on the Locumba River, within the territory still
under the control of Peru. Tacna was given the title and privileges of a
town by supreme decree in 1823, in recognition of the brave services its
people had rendered to the cause of Independence; and a few years later
it was raised to the dignity of “Heroic City,” when it became the
capital of the province. The government authorities of that part of the
province of Tacna occupied by Peru reside at Ilabaya, in the
northwestern district of Ilabaya, a picturesque town on the river of the
same name. The province of Tarata has also two capitals, the Chilean
authorities occupying Tarata, and the Peruvian government being centred
at Candarave, sixty miles from Locumba.

[Illustration: CALLE SAN MARTIN, NEAR PARK ENTRANCE, TACNA.]

The Sama valley is a rich agricultural district, its products including
sugar, cotton, maize, wine, and an abundance of pasturage for cattle and
horses. Ascending the valley from the coast, the scene is one of
continually increasing verdure and beauty. The Sama River receives its
chief tributaries, the Chaspaya, Tarata, and Estique, as it crosses the
province of Tarata, this region being also drained by the tributaries of
the Locumba,—the Curibaya and Ilabaya. In this valley are grown grapes
of a quality and flavor especially suitable for the sweet wines that are
manufactured here as well as in the neighboring valleys of Moquegua. On
the green uplands and along the banks of these rivers, cattle and horses
find pasture all the year round; and in the sierra, especially on the
high plateau near Puno, may be seen the alpaca and vicuña, from the
glossy coat of which are made fine and beautiful fabrics. The Cordillera
del Barroso, the name given to that part of the Andean range which
crosses Tacna and Arica, is described by Carlos Cisneros in his atlas of
Peru as _sui generis_ in configuration, not presenting the aspect of a
series of mountains sloping from lofty peaks to lower levels, but
forming rather a high plateau, fourteen thousand feet or more above sea
level, with colossal _cerros_, or peaks, rising here and there in
solitary grandeur. Their crests, once burning volcanoes, are now covered
with a perpetual mantle of snow. Here the vicuña loves to make his
haunts, far from the disturbing fears that drive him from inhabited
districts to find a home in the highest and coldest regions of the
sierra. Tutupaca, Chipicani, Sahama, and other extinct volcanoes of this
region present a wonderful sight in their sublime solitude.

[Illustration: VIEW OF THE SUMMIT OF THE SIERRA, TACNA.]

The completion of the new railway from Ilo to Moquegua is of importance
not only to the Littoral Province of Moquegua, but also to northwestern
Tacna and Tarata, which are thereby placed in closer and easier
communication with maritime traffic. The extension of this line to
Desaguadero would undoubtedly prove a strong competitor to the Arica and
La Paz route, as it would be shorter and over a less broken country. The
people of Peru strongly resent the continued postponement of the
plebiscite, feeling that Chile has taken unfair advantage of that
“possession which is nine-tenths of the law;” but it is hoped that in
the greater unity which has become a feature of the international policy
of South American countries—and which is particularly evident in the
readiness shown by all these republics to settle their disputes through
arbitration—a solution of this vexed question will be made satisfactory
to both of the governments concerned.

                              CHAPTER XXVI
                 MINES OF THE SIERRA AND OTHER REGIONS


[Illustration: SCENE AT THE BORAX MINES OF AREQUIPA.]

All the world is familiar with stories of the Incas’ splendor and the
viceroys’ luxury, based on the enormous riches of Peruvian mines in past
centuries. Gold and silver seem to have run in streams of never-failing
abundance from the sierras of this wonderful country, their wealth
gleaming in temples dedicated to the worship of the Sun in pre-Columbian
days and forming a pavement for the footsteps of viceregal princes in
the no less flourishing period of colonial Spain. But it is not
generally known that the decline of this abundance was due entirely to
other causes than an exhaustion of the source of supply, and that the
mineral wealth of Peru to-day is, for practical purposes, as great as
ever. The progressive spirit of modern enterprise promises to restore
the prestige once enjoyed by Peru as the richest mining country of the
globe.

The natural development of the mining industry was first arrested when
repeated uprisings of the Indians interfered with its interests,
especially during the latter part of the eighteenth century; and it was
still further checked by the war of Independence, which, although it
brought the blessings of national freedom, left the country in a
condition of political disorder and confusion, with all industry
comparatively at a standstill. The young republic had neither funds nor
experience adequate to meet the needs of industrial development; and,
for many years, political matters held supremacy in the national
councils, to the great detriment of trade and financial well-being.

But when the effects of constitutional liberty began to be apparent in a
more stable government, and the decline of militarism was succeeded by
an increasing interest in economic affairs, the nation turned its
attention to many sources of wealth that had remained practically
unworked for half a century, and the government stimulated this
awakening spirit of enterprise by making laws calculated to encourage
individual endeavor in every branch of industry. The inauguration of the
School of Mines in 1876, and the adoption, the following year, of laws
governing mining property so as to ensure perpetual and irrevocable
ownership, proved of great importance in promoting the mining interests
of the country. Foreign capital was encouraged by the liberal attitude
of the Peruvian government to make large investments in mineral lands of
the sierra, and from this period date many of the extensive foreign
enterprises now established in Peru.

The mining code now in force was promulgated in 1901; it has given
additional impulse to the industry, as, by its terms, every facility is
afforded for the acquirement of mining property, as well as ample
liberty in working it and perfect security in possession. The rights of
the foreigner are the same as those of the Peruvian mine owner, no
distinction of nationality being made in the conditions of ownership. By
the law of 1877, each mining claim is subject to a half-yearly tax of
fifteen soles (seven dollars and fifty cents, gold), which guarantees
possession as long as it is punctually paid. A special law, passed in
1890, further guarantees that, until the year 1915, no new tax can be
imposed on the mining industry or on the export of its products.

A mining claim, or _pertenencia_, is usually marked off in the form of a
parallelogram, one hundred by two hundred metres in area, and is of
indefinite depth. The measurement is made from an angle indicated by the
concessionaire. A _pertenencia_ for a placer-mining property, a platinum
bed, petroleum deposit, tin or coal mine, is measured in the form of a
square of two hundred and thirty metres each side. The maximum of a
single concession is sixty adjoining claims, but any person or company
may solicit as many concessions as desired, though a separate petition
must be made for each, the only charge for this privilege being a stamp
of five soles, which covers the cost, whether the concession is for one
claim or sixty.

Mining property is conceded under the direction of the government,
through the Department of Fomento, in which a general register of mines
is kept, containing a record of all the mining property in the republic
with the names of concessionaires and the extent and locality of their
claims. As an encouragement to the development of mining, the
importation of materials and machinery required in the elaboration of
metals and the construction of railroads for their transportation is
allowed free of custom house duties. The government organized, in 1902,
the Corps of Mining Engineers, whose duties are to promote the mining
interests of Peru by providing the most thorough information obtainable
regarding the geology and mineralogy of the country. Commissions have
been appointed by this organization to explore and examine new regions
and to ascertain their mineral wealth, so as to secure such knowledge
about them as may be necessary in the granting of concessions and the
general exploitation of mining lands. Regular bulletins are published by
the Corps of Mining Engineers, giving the results of these explorations,
their pages being usually illustrated with interesting views of the
regions traversed by the appointed commissions. The School of Mines has
been of invaluable service in promoting a technical knowledge of mining
among the young men of those districts where such an education is of the
greatest importance. Graduates of this school are prepared to assume the
management of a mine, and are qualified to direct the various
departments of mining industry.

Although it is not only in the region of the sierra that valuable
minerals are extracted,—since gold placers are worked in the coast
districts of Nasca and Camaná, as well as in the valleys of Sandia and
Carabaya, and elsewhere in the Montaña,—the riches of the Peruvian
Cordilleras are so enormous and so varied that to speak of the sierra
is, of necessity, to refer to its mines. The Nudo of Cerro de Pasco and
the Nudo of Vilcanota especially appear to form storehouses full of vast
treasures of metallic ore; gold, silver, copper, and other mineral
products abound; and the companies now engaged in developing these
regions are daily opening up new properties of increasing importance.

Cerro de Pasco and Yauli are the principal silver and copper mining
districts of Peru. At Cerro de Pasco, nearly every kind of mineral is
found within a radius of a mile. A North American syndicate purchased
the mining properties of this district, the first engineers arriving to
take charge of the property in 1901. The following year the syndicate
bought the concession for the construction of a railway from Oroya to
Cerro de Pasco, the line being completed and opened to traffic in 1904.
This railway is eighty-two miles long, and has a branch twenty-five
miles long to the coal mines, while the switches at the mines and
smelter cover twenty miles more. The road is standard gauge and the
locomotives and cars are of North American manufacture. The original
cost of construction and equipment was about three million dollars. The
work of putting up a smelter and furnaces was completed in 1906, and a
reverberatory and roasting plant is now being installed, which will
greatly increase the production of the establishment. In 1907 the annual
capacity was thirty million pounds of pig-copper, and with the new
improvements it is estimated that the quantity will be nearly doubled.

[Illustration: CAILLOMA MINES, ALTITUDE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FEET,
DEPARTMENT OF AREQUIPA.]

The mines of Cerro de Pasco have been developed by shafts, the lowest
level being at a depth of over four hundred feet. The present output
supplies the smelter, besides which an ore reserve is accumulated. All
the properties of the company were purchased from small owners, and
include over six hundred claims in the Cerro de Pasco district, besides
about three hundred claims in Goillarisquisga, a few miles to the north,
where valuable coal mines are located, furnishing eight hundred tons of
this fuel daily. New properties have been recently purchased in the
Morococha district, which is rich in copper and silver. In addition to
these mines, the company owns the Paria estate at Cerro de Pasco,
covering seventy thousand acres, which is used for pasturage and dairy
purposes. A considerable population is supported by the various
enterprises of the company, five hundred men being employed on the
railway, sixteen hundred in the smelter, a thousand in the silver and
copper mines and fifteen hundred in the coal mines. The syndicate has
spent about eighteen million dollars on all these properties, including
the cost of improvements and development, and is now in possession of
one of the most valuable mining districts of the world.

[Illustration: CARMEN SHAFT, CERRO DE PASCO MINES.]

The “Opulent City of Cerro de Pasco,” as it was entitled by a supreme
decree of 1840, is a typical town of the Peruvian sierras. It was
founded by the Viceroy Amat in 1771, and became one of the most
important towns of the Intendencia of Tarma, which, under the colonial
government, embraced the present Departments of Junín, Huánuco, and
Ancash. Cerro de Pasco was made the capital of the Department of Junín
in 1851; the cities of Jauja, Tarma, and Huancayo shared with it the
prestige of political centres, being provincial capitals. Jauja,
unsurpassed as a sanatorium, and destined to become a famous health
resort, is one of the oldest towns of Spanish-America, having been
founded by the conquerors before the site of Lima was selected for the
capital of Peru. Tarma, founded about the same time as Jauja, is rich in
minerals and claims additional importance from its situation on the
highway of travel between Lima and Iquitos.

In the districts of Yauli and Huarochiri, which rank next in importance
to Cerro de Pasco, silver and copper are also the principal metals
extracted, though lead is an important product. Smelters and other
establishments for the elaboration of gold, silver, and copper, have
been installed at these places, the works at Casapalca, in the Yauli
district, being especially notable. For some classes and grades of
minerals, the process of smelting is followed, while in the treatment of
others concentration is adopted. Yauli is located on the line of the
Oroya railway, in the province of Tarma, Department of Junín, and
Huarochiri lies a few leagues to the south, in the Department of Lima.
Both these mining districts are worked at an altitude of twelve thousand
feet or more. In the same region of the sierra are situated the
silver-mining centres of Castrovireina, Huallanca, and Cajatambo, in the
Departments of Huancavelica, Huánuco, and Ancash; and farther north, in
La Libertad and Cajamarca, are the mines of Salpo and Hualgayoc, which
are rich in silver ores.

Everywhere in the Andean region silver is found, though it is usually
mixed with copper or lead. Most of the silver ore in the Cerro de Pasco
district is of a reddish color, due to the oxide of iron it contains;
the Peruvian miners give it the name of _cascajo_, or gravel. The copper
ores, like the silver, appear in combination with other metals, veins of
copper containing usually some silver and gold. In Ancash, Ica, and
Arequipa, in the coast zone, these copper deposits are also found, and
new smelting establishments have been installed in these departments
which are contributing to increase the output of copper ore. New copper
mines have been explored in the provinces of Jauja, Pasco, and
elsewhere, and prove to be rich in ores. The industry is in a more
promising condition than it has ever been. Petitions for concessions of
mining property are constantly reaching the government, a favorable
augury for the future development of this valuable resource. Lead exists
in large quantities in Yauli, Huarochiri, and several districts of
Ancash and Cuzco.

[Illustration: THE MAIN STREET OF CERRO DE PASCO.]

The Nudo of Vilcanota embraces an extensive mining region to the north
and west of Lake Titicaca; and the veins of precious metals follow the
course of the Cordilleras, which, after separating, form the Nudo of
Cerro de Pasco. The Cailloma mines, in Arequipa, and those of the
Lucanas district, in Ayacucho,—both rich in silver,—are located in the
western range, while those of Cuzco belong to the eastern and central
Cordilleras. Puno lies in the heart of a vast mineral region; in its
provinces some of the most productive mines of Peru are to be found. The
Inca Mining Company, in which more than a million dollars of North
American capital is invested, has developed gold mines of enormous value
in the province of Carabaya, supplying about nine-tenths of the gold
coined in Peru, and having a monthly output amounting in value to ten
thousand pounds sterling. The history of this enterprise is an
interesting sequel to the record of gold-mining in colonial days.

During the period of the viceroyalty, the gold mines of the province of
Puno produced vast wealth, the viceroy once sending as a gift to Charles
V. a nugget that weighed a hundred pounds, taken from San Juan del Oro;
and one of his successors presented to Philip IV. another famous nugget,
shaped like a man’s head and of great size. When the Indians revolted
against Spanish authority a few years before the war of the
Independence, those of Carabaya and Sandia joined the rebel ranks and
slaughtered their masters, hoping to be relieved from the hard work of
the mines. This uprising, and the war of Independence that followed,
caused the mining industry to be totally neglected until the middle of
the last century, when a party of explorers looking for cascarilla bark
found gold in the bed of the Challuma River, and a rush followed, which
lasted for two or three years. During that time several million dollars’
worth of gold was taken out, and a nugget weighing over four pounds was
presented to General Castilla, then president of Peru. But the system of
mining employed was primitive and, after the first excitement passed,
only a few gold-diggers remained, the mines from that time being worked
on a small scale until the Inca Mining Company purchased the Santo
Domingo property a few years ago and set up a large establishment.

[Illustration: A MINING TOWN OF THE PUNA.]

The discovery of the Santo Domingo gold mine was made by a Peruvian, Don
Manuel Estrada, but it was the enterprising spirit of two North American
prospectors, Chester Brown and Wallace Hardison, which led to its being
exploited on a large scale. Mr. Hardison had seen, in Lima, samples of
rich ore that had been found in Carabaya, and he was not long in making
his way to the goldfields to investigate further. He was joined by Mr.
Brown and they went to Santo Domingo together, starting from the
Southern railway terminus at Juliaca on muleback, accompanied by their
guides, and having with them a number of llamas laden with provisions
and blankets. Both courage and faith were required to follow up a trail
in such a rugged, mountainous country as that over which the Americans
travelled. Part of the route was across the high sierra, sixteen
thousand feet above sea level, where the riders could look on a sea of
clouds rolling below, while the sun blazed down from a sky of wonderful
blue. Only those who have travelled on these heights know how clear are
the skies and how piercing is the white light of the sun at these
altitudes. When there is no sun, the weather is freezing cold. The
wealth of the Santo Domingo mine was apparent to the prospectors from
the first, and the Inca Mining Company was organized at once with
capital to purchase the property.

[Illustration: LLAMAS AND DONKEYS AWAITING CARGO AT CERRO DE PASCO.]

The Inca Mining Company established headquarters at Tirapata, on the
Southern railway between Juliaca and Cuzco, and immediately began to
develop their mining property. A concession was obtained from the
Peruvian government, under which the company built a wagon road from
Tirapata to Santo Domingo, a distance of one hundred and fifty miles. In
return for opening up the country in this way, the company received
about two thousand acres for every mile of wagon road completed. The
route lies almost due north for seventy miles, from Tirapata to Crucero,
passing the small towns of Asillo and San Anton, in the midst of
excellent grazing lands for sheep and alpacas. Crucero, which was once
the capital of Carabaya province, is also the centre of a pastoral
district. A few miles beyond Crucero the road crosses the Aricoma Pass
at an altitude of sixteen thousand feet, and then begins the descent of
the eastern slope of the Andes to Limbani, which marks the beginning of
the timber line and the limit of established government authority. From
this point the journey is made at times through the virgin forest and
always through a region little frequented by the white man. Agualani
Station is the next stopping place, where travellers find sleeping
accommodations. After leaving this place, the road crosses the Inambari
River at La Oroya, over a bridge three hundred feet long, and a few
hours’ riding brings one to Santo Domingo. The administration house of
the company at Santo Domingo is built of solid mahogany and fitted up
with all modern comforts. Here in the heart of the forest, hundreds of
miles from a railway, are to be found the conveniences of electric
lights, hot baths, electric fans, and other comforts supposed to belong
only to the favored residents of a great metropolis. The employés have a
tennis court, and a telephone connects Santo Domingo with Tirapata,
which has telegraphic communication with the other cities of the
republic and, through them, with the outside world. Modern mining
machinery has been put up at Santo Domingo, at great cost of labor and
money; three years were consumed in getting the stamp mill to the mines.
A few miles beyond Santo Domingo the rubber country begins, through
which the company has built a road to the Madre de Dios, as elsewhere
described. In the same region in which the Inca Mining Company’s
properties are located are the mines of Montebello and the Lavaderos de
Oro, famous in colonial times. The Lavaderos de Oro mines are in
Carabaya, the streams of which are nearly all gold-bearing. The
Rinconada Mining Company of North America, with a capital of two million
dollars, is working rich properties in the districts of Poto and Quiaca,
province of Sandia.

There is not a single Department of Peru in which gold has not been
found, though in many districts its mining is still among the primitive
industries, the Indians washing it out of the streams that drain their
_communidades_, and using the nuggets and gold dust as a medium of
exchange. It is not unusual for an Indian of the Marañon, Sandia,
Urubamba, or other valleys, to offer a little sack of gold nuggets in
payment for his tobacco and similar luxuries purchased in the stores of
interior towns. A curious process of placer-mining has long existed
among the Indians, which is supposed to be the origin of one of their
popular sayings that “in Peru one can sow stones and harvest gold.” It
is still in vogue in some districts, and consists in laying flat stones
along the bed of a gold-bearing river during the dry season, in such a
way that, when the rains come and the mountain streams bring down in
their current the precious gravel, these nuggets are caught in the
spaces between the stones and held there. When the river falls, or
disappears, as it does in many cases during the dry season, the Indian
sower of stones reaps his harvest of gold.

[Illustration: OLD CHURCH IN THE MINING TOWN OF CAILLOMA.]

The question of transportation has hitherto been such a very important
factor in determining whether mining properties were worth developing or
not, that some rich deposits have been allowed to remain untouched, and
regions known to abound in valuable metals have been only partly
explored, on account of the difficulty and expense attending any effort
to penetrate beyond a certain radius, accessible to the railways. In
this connection, the work of the Corps of Mining Engineers has proved of
inestimable value, their surveys extending to every region, so that they
are rapidly effacing from the map of Peru its _Territorio inexplorado_.
Every expedition sent into the interior returns with fresh information
regarding the country’s mineral resources; and deposits, hitherto
unknown to exist, have been brought to light under the investigations of
scientific commissions.

[Illustration: MINERS ARRIVING AT AN INN IN THE SIERRA.]

In colonial days, Peru was famous for its quicksilver deposits, and the
mine of Santa Barbara in the Department of Huancavelica, was the centre
of this industry, which was of great service in facilitating the
amalgamation of silver ores. The history of Huancavelica is one of the
most interesting pages in the mining records of Peru, the quicksilver
mines of this region being, in the time of the viceroyalty, the richest
in the world. Cinnabar has been proved to exist in abundance for thirty
miles around the Santa Barbara mine, in as many as fifty hills of the
neighborhood. Veins of this red sulphuret of mercury are also found in
the Departments of Cajamarca, Huánuco, Junín, Ayacucho, Cuzco, and Puno,
and it has been worked in various mines. The mineral production of
Huancavelica is undergoing a revival, and a new era of prosperity is
dawning for this historic district.

The discovery of large deposits of bituminous and anthracite coal is
regarded as of particular importance in a country where it is required
so generally for mining purposes. The exploitation of this mineral is
just beginning to show results, the mines of Goillarisquisga being the
most important. Anthracite coal is found in Ancash, La Libertad, and
other departments; in Cuzco are beds of coal containing the trunks of
trees perfectly carbonized. Along the lower banks of the Ucayali River,
and in various districts of Puno, lignite exists in considerable
quantities. Peat is abundant, especially in Junín, where it is known as
_champa_. It is used a great deal throughout this region, and is a
combustible of great value.

With gold, silver, copper, and coal as the basis of her mineral wealth,
Peru has numerous other deposits which, once developed, must yield a
large revenue. Already the petroleum wells of Tumbes, Piura, and Puno
give promise of producing great wealth, and new discoveries of this
liquid bitumen are continually being made. It is found at Chimbote and
near Casma,—both in Ancash Department,—and it abounds in the district of
Palpa, in Ica. Jauja, Huancavelica, and Cuzco also have petroleum
deposits, and there are evidences of its presence in several other
districts. Foreign capital is already invested in this field, which is
apparently of vast productiveness. The two principal centres of the
industry at present are in the northern coast region—especially at
Tumbes and Piura—and in the vicinity of Like Titicaca, in the district
of Pusi, Department of Puno. There are two petroleum refineries in Peru,
and these are but the forerunners of more extensive establishments. The
Titicaca Oil Company sank eight wells in the Department of Puno, in five
of which oil was struck, and the industry has attracted the attention of
capitalists who are prepared to develop it on a large scale.

[Illustration: SAN JULIAN MINE, CASTROVIRREINA.]

In Tumbes and Piura, great masses of sulphur have been found almost on
the surface of the soil, and the beds are being worked by a rich
company. The mineral contains fifty per cent of sulphur, and when
elaborated the product is ninety-eight pure. The coast country is rich
in mineral salts, especially of soda, magnesia, etc.; chloride of sodium
is found in Morrope, in the Department of Lambayeque, and saltpetre
exists not only in the provinces of the coast but in Cajamarca and other
interior departments. There are important beds of borax in several of
the southern states, those of Arequipa yielding large quantities of this
useful product. The borax beds of Arequipa were discovered in 1893 by
Don Juan Manuel de Escurra, who formed a company for their exploitation,
the enterprise being now in the hands of a large syndicate, the Borax
Consolidated Limited, which has an extensive establishment, with all
modern improvements, including twelve reverberatory ovens for drying the
borax. The Laguna de Salinas, where the borax is found, lies just west
of Arequipa on the pampa between the Misti and the Pichu-Pichu.

[Illustration: THE MINING TOWN OF CASAPALCA, DEPARTMENT OF LIMA.]

Iron is met with in almost every mining district of Peru. In the
province of Calca, in Cuzco, mines have been discovered containing iron
with a grade of eighty per cent pure metal. They have been little worked
owing to the expense connected with their exploitation. Nickel abounds
in the northern districts of Ayacucho; mica of superior quality has
recently been found in one of the coast provinces of Arequipa; bismuth
exists in various districts, and Junín has deposits of bismuth-ochre
containing forty per cent of bismuth. Molybdenum, which is constantly
increasing in demand for amalgamating purposes, is exploited in Jauja
and Cerro de Pasco; and, in the neighboring Department of Ayacucho,
iron, manganese, and wolfram are taken out of the mines of Lircay. It
would be difficult to name a mineral that is not to be found somewhere
in Peru; and its marbles, granites, and other fine stones are of the
highest value for architectural and constructive work. Kaolin, cement,
and other clays for ceramic purposes are abundant, and may be utilized
in manufacturing the finest pottery and porcelains. The ancient
Peruvians had the secret of making their urns and vases of pottery so
very light in weight as to be remarkable for this feature among all the
ancient potteries; one of the tests used by experts in determining
whether the _huacas_ that are sold as antiques in the Lima stores are
genuine or false consists in weighing the article, the modern imitators
being unable to produce a pottery as light as the original.

The exports from Peruvian mines show increasing development of the
mining industry annually. The production of silver last year amounted to
about five million dollars in value, and of copper to a little over that
amount; petroleum was taken out to the value of a million and a half
dollars, gold of a million dollars, and other minerals in paying
quantities. During 1907, the Cerro de Pasco mine shipped ten thousand
tons of copper, more than a third of all that South America exported to
the United States that year, and the output for 1908 is estimated at
fifteen thousand tons. It is predicted that the ultimate copper output
of Cerro de Pasco will reach fifty thousand tons.

                             CHAPTER XXVII
              THE OROYA RAILWAY, THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD


[Illustration: CHOSICA BRIDGE, OROYA ROUTE.]

The central mining region of the sierra is connected with the chief
national seaport by the Central Railway, or, as it is popularly called,
the Oroya Route, one of the most important lines of Peru and the most
remarkable in the world, not only because of the altitude attained at
its highest point, sixteen thousand feet above sea level, but as a
colossal feat of engineering unequalled in railway construction. No
other railway route compares with that of Oroya as an example of daring
enterprise in the face of tremendous obstacles; and it stands a great
monument to the awakened spirit of progress which began to be shown as
soon as militarism declined in Peru, and which has become especially
evident in the moral and material development of that country within the
past decade.

The building of the Oroya railway was begun in 1870, under the direction
of a North American engineer, Mr. Henry Meiggs, with whom the contract
for its construction was signed by the Peruvian government. Within six
years, the line was opened up to traffic as far as Chicla, ninety miles
from Callao, at an altitude of thirteen thousand feet, and was graded
and placed under construction from that point to Ticlio, near the summit
of Mount Meiggs, where the Galera tunnel pierces the peak at an altitude
of sixteen thousand feet, the highest place along the line. In 1877, Mr.
Meiggs died, and the work was suspended, having already cost nearly five
million pounds sterling. The war with Chile followed, bringing a train
of evils in its wake, and the government found it impossible to continue
the construction until 1891, when the line was taken over by the
Peruvian Corporation and completed to Oroya, being opened in 1893. A
branch line had been built by Mr. Meiggs from Lima to Ancón soon after
beginning his work, and to this have been added the Morocochu branch,
from Ticlio to Morococha, and the Cerro de Pasco line, the property of
the Cerro de Pasco Mining Company, from Oroya to the great mining
centre. The Oroya Route has recently been extended to Huancayo, and is
under construction to Ayacucho. It will be continued to Abancay and
Cuzco, to unite with the line connecting Cuzco with Puno, which is to be
extended to the Desaguadero River on the boundary between Peru and
Bolivia, where it will join the Guaqui and La Paz railway, to form part
of the great Pan-American system. From Cerro de Pasco northward, the
trunk line has been built as far as Goillarisquisga, and is under
construction from that point to Huánuco, to join other links in the
chain which, when completed, will extend, in Peru, from the border of
Ecuador to Lake Titicaca.

[Illustration: CHOSICA, A HEALTH RESORT ON THE OROYA ROUTE.]

From Callao to Oroya, the distance is less than a hundred and fifty
miles, but along this short route the railway passes through every
variety of scenery and climate, from the sandy level of a tropical coast
to the frozen peaks of the lofty _puna_, far above the limit vegetation.
Between these extremes lie the flourishing sugar plantations and maize
fields of the coast; orchards of chirimoyas, paltas, peaches, apricots,
granadillas, oranges, lemons, etc., that grow on the lower slopes of the
sierra; all the flowers, ferns, and mountain shrubs that nourish in
rocky glens and shady ravines under nature’s most favorable conditions,
up to a height of ten thousand feet; and, above this limit, the bare,
bleak aspect of the _puna_, where mining establishments mark the
locality of rich veins of precious metal, and the circle of the horizon
is everywhere limited by snow-clad summits. Along the valley of the
Rimac River, from the sea to its source, the Oroya railway climbs the
sierra with innumerable curves and yet without a single decline
throughout its length until the highest altitude is passed in the Galera
tunnel, and the descent begins on the slope of the inter-Andean valley.
More than twenty bridges cross the river along the course of the
railway; the mountain side is tunnelled in many places, and in others
the line hangs over precipices projecting so far out that a stone
dropped from the car as it curves along the brink falls on the opposite
bank of the river below.

[Illustration: MATUCANA, EIGHT THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA, OROYA
ROUTE.]

The journey from Lima to Oroya may be made in a day, the train leaving
the station of Desamparados at eight o’clock in the morning and arriving
at Oroya at five in the evening. It affords an opportunity to see one of
the scenic wonders of the world, and is an experience never to be
forgotten. As the train leaves the Lima station, a short distance from
the Balta bridge and within full view of the broad bed of the Rimac, the
retreating city offers only a partial glimpse of its gleaming church
towers and the avenues of shade trees that adorn its suburbs. The
picturesque Cerro of San Cristobal, with a cross illuminating its
summit, stands out in clear relief against the sky and may be seen until
the train passes behind the Andean foothills on its way to Santa Clara.
Although this point is more than a thousand feet above sea level, it
differs little in aspect from the country around Lima. Wherever the
waters of the Rimac have been brought into service to fertilize the
gardens and plantations of the valley, exuberant vegetation exists, and
abundant harvests smile under the blue skies; it is only beyond this
strip of green that the sandy plain and gray, barren hillsides are to be
seen. That the Incas had all the coast region under cultivation is
indicated by the existence of their ruined cities in the very midst of
the desert and their _andenes_ along hillsides that, to-day, are counted
of little value for agricultural purposes. At Santa Clara, a short walk
from the station takes one to the ruins of an Incaic town, which, to
judge from what remains, must have been a very populous settlement
centuries ago. Its appearance to-day is one of utter dreariness, and it
is difficult to imagine what charm such a site could have offered for
the location of a city.

[Illustration: RAILWAY STATION IN THE SIERRA, OROYA ROUTE.]

For fifteen miles beyond Santa Clara, the railway train climbs upward
until the town of Chosica is reached, the scenery increasing in beauty
as the valley narrows between the hills of the sierra and the foliage of
the mountain side grows fresher and of more gorgeous hues. Chosica is
one of the most popular health resorts of Peru, and has a delightful
climate all the year round. Situated in the midst of mountains at an
altitude of three thousand feet, it possesses many advantages as a
sanitarium for invalids, and is a pleasant place of residence for those
who like a restful and quiet retreat. The sky is blue during most of the
year, and the pure atmosphere is exhilarating to tired nerves and
over-wrought spirits. Here one may enjoy life in its simplicity, as
Chosica has not taken on the fashionable airs and expensive luxuries of
the modern spa, though supplying its greatest benefits. Aside from its
attractiveness as a health resort and a picturesque mountain city,
Chosica is important as the first distributing point for the electricity
which supplies light and power to the cities of Lima and Callao and
their suburbs.

[Illustration: CHILCA, A MINING TOWN ON THE OROYA ROUTE.]

From Chosica to Matucana, the scenery is ever-varying and always
magnificent. The train climbs five thousand feet within a distance of
thirty miles, crossing the chasm of the river many times and plunging
through tunnels that succeed one another with remarkable frequency.
Purguay and Corona are the first bridges of importance along the line.
Soon after leaving them behind, the train sweeps around the magnificent
curve of San Bartolomé, passing through its famous orchards and gardens,
and bringing into view all the glories of mountain foliage that adorn
the sierra at this altitude. Purple and white heliotrope, convolvulus,
clematis, the maguey plant, and the cactus are seen in profusion. Birds
of bright plumage and butterflies of variegated wings give life to a
scene which is impressively silent, save for the hard breathing of the
locomotive as it plods sturdily around the curves. Though the valley
broadens at San Bartolomé, it is soon enclosed again between gigantic
walls of mountains; and, a few miles further on, the Verrugas bridge,
the longest and highest of the Oroya Route, spans the space between
opposite walls of granite that rise from the river bed to tower among
the clouds. This bridge is five hundred and seventy-five feet long and
two hundred and twenty-five feet above the river, which looks like a
ribbon of silver as it sparkles at the bottom of the ravine. After
crossing Verrugas bridge, the train disappears for a moment in the
tunnel of Cuesta Blanca, emerging in the midst of the grandest scenery
imaginable as it pushes on through Surco and across the Challapa bridge
to Matucana, where a welcome half-hour’s stop is made. Matucana is, like
Chosica, a favorite health resort, and the pines and eucalyptus trees of
the neighborhood give added healthfulness to its pure mountain air. Few
people suffer from the rarity of the atmosphere at this altitude, though
it is well to spend a night here, if one can spare two days for the trip
to Oroya, the rapid ascent from sea level to sixteen thousand feet above
being a severe trial to the respiration. _Soroche_, as the mountain
sickness is called, does not attack everyone, nor is there any certainty
as to its visitation; many people have made repeated trips without
feeling any inconvenience, and have been surprised by an attack when
they thought themselves immune, while others never reach the high
altitudes without suffering from _soroche_. The degree of this most
uncomfortable experience varies according to one’s constitution. With
some it is confined to a strenuous effort “to get one’s breath,” while,
with others, the sensation is that of having the head slowly squeezed in
a vice, or inflated by some process that threatens to burst it like an
over-filled balloon. None of the phases of _soroche_ are agreeable, but,
happily, the disturbance disappears as soon as a lower altitude is
reached.

[Illustration: OROYA.]

As the railway follows the valley of the Rimac toward its source, the
river gorge becomes ever narrower, the enclosing mountains higher, and
the scenery more wildly grand and rugged. The railway train follows the
tortuous line of the gorge, zigzagging along the precipice, visible only
for a few seconds from any point along the route. After leaving
Matucana, the course is taken through the very heart of the sierra, the
train crossing first the bridge of the Negra quebrada, then the great
links of Tambo de Viso and Champichaca in quick succession, these
wonderful structures spanning the chasm at short intervals of three or
four miles. From the car window, the passenger looks down into the
depths below and up to the towering peaks, and feels much as if
travelling in mid-air. At Tamboraque, which is situated nearly ten
thousand feet above the sea, the scene changes, and the region of the
higher sierra comes into view, with its mining towns and snow mountains.
San Mateo quebrada, in the depths of which lies the picturesque town of
the same name, is hardly passed before the train crosses, a mile away,
one of the most remarkable bridges of the whole line, the Infernillo. It
stretches across a narrow ravine between two walls of rocks, both of
which are tunnelled so as to provide a passage for the railway. As the
train flashes out on the bridge from invisible depths on one side and
disappears as mysteriously on the other, the effect is singularly weird.
From this point to Galera tunnel the ascent is very steep and winding,
the train climbing five thousand feet in twenty-five miles, crossing
several bridges and passing through a number of tunnels.

All along the Oroya Route, from San Mateo to its terminus in the sierra,
are scattered mining towns of growing importance. Rio Blanco, five miles
from San Mateo, has important smelting works, and Chicla, four miles
away, a thousand feet higher up the Cordillera, lies in the heart of a
rich mineral district. It occupies a picturesque location, especially as
seen from the car window after the train has made the immense loop
necessary to carry it across the valley and up the opposite slope on its
way to Casapalca and Ticlio. From this eminence a magnificent view of
the valley appears, with Chicla nestling below and snow-clad mountains
looming in the distance.

Casapalca is a typical mining town of the sierra, with its smelters
spread over the bare, brown hillside, its great chimneys and its smoke.
It is situated at an altitude of thirteen thousand feet, and has a cold
climate all the year round, invigorating and healthful. From Casapalca
to Ticlio the distance is about ten miles, and the region of perpetual
snow appears as the train pulls up the last few leagues toward the
Galera tunnel. The summit of Mount Meiggs, which is seventeen thousand
five hundred and seventy-five feet high, is nearly always wrapped in
snow, though the tunnel entrance is below the perpetual snow line.

Of the sixty tunnels along the Oroya Route, that of Galera is the
longest, measuring nearly four thousand feet in length. It is in the
middle of this tunnel that the highest point along the line is reached.
From this tunnel eastward, the train descends toward Oroya, passing
through the mining town of Yauli and skirting the bank of the
inter-Andean River Mantaro, a branch of the Perene, which, later, joins
the Ucayali on its way to the main waters of the Amazon. When the train
stops at Oroya, sunset is already approaching, and the colors of the
retiring monarch of day are to be seen reflected on the surrounding
peaks and glowing in the western sky. From the window of the little
hotel where lodging is found for the night, one looks on a humble though
interesting scene of pastoral simplicity. Llamas graze wherever the
coarse puna grass is found, and an occasional vicuña may be seen. The
altitude of Oroya is little more than twelve thousand feet, and a
greater descent is made from Oroya to Jauja and Huancayo, the latter
being only about ten thousand feet above sea level. From Oroya to Cerro
de Pasco, the railway makes an ascent of nearly two thousand feet.

                             CHAPTER XXVIII
      A TRIP OVER THE SOUTHERN ROUTE—NEW RAILWAYS AND PUBLIC ROADS


[Illustration: IRON BRIDGE OVER THE URUBAMBA RIVER.]

In no country have greater obstacles been overcome in the construction
of railways and public roads than in Peru, the physical features of
which present the most varied peculiarities. The millions that were
spent in building the Oroya railway alone would have sufficed to cover
many times its mileage on a level plain; and nearly all the railways of
the country present evidences of difficult engineering and expensive
construction. The lines at present in operation cover about fifteen
hundred miles, while those projected and under construction will more
than double that mileage. Most of these railways are the property of the
state, the Peruvian Corporation having the use and management of them
until 1956. Several important lines belong to Peruvian or foreign
enterprises, or to private concerns; and in the extension of existing
railways, these enterprises play an important part. The branch from
Oroya to Cerro de Pasco was built by North American capital; and new
lines are being constructed by other foreign companies. The railways
which in 1890 were turned over to the Peruvian Corporation for a term of
years in cancellation of the foreign debt of Peru, included, in addition
to the Central, or Oroya Route, the Southern railway, and the shorter
lines from Paita to Piura, sixty miles; from Pacasmayo to Guadalupe and
Yonan, the same distance; from Salaverry to Trujillo and Ascope, fifty
miles; from Chimbote to Suchiman, thirty miles; and from Pisco to Ica,
fifty miles. Some of these lines have since been extended, the Southern
railway having been completed to Cuzco in the present year.

[Illustration: ANCIENT SUSPENSION BRIDGE ON THE ROAD FROM HUANCAYO TO
CAÑETE.]

The Southern railway covers a distance of two hundred and eighty-five
miles, from the seaport of Mollendo to Juliaca, where it divides, the
main line going from Juliaca to Cuzco, two hundred miles to the north,
and a short branch extending south for twenty-five miles to the port of
Puno, on Lake Titicaca. The first section of this railway was built in
1870, from Mollendo to Arequipa, across the arid sandhills of the coast.
A journey over this of the road has little to offer in variety of
scenery, yet there is a peculiar fascination about its drifting
crescents that seem to move with rhythmical undulation like the waves of
the sea. Barren and dull as the prospect appears, it is not without
interest, because so unlike anything one sees elsewhere. Along the first
part of the route, a glimpse of green fields brightens the view as the
train skirts the valley of Tambo before entering the Pampas of Cachendo
and Islay, where not a blade of grass is to be seen. But the most of the
route lies across the Pampas until, within a few miles of Arequipa, the
sierra comes into view, and the fertile valley of Vitor is passed, with
its plantations of maize and its flourishing orchards. From this point,
a new railway is being built to the valleys of Siguas, Majes, and
Camaná, in southwestern Arequipa. As the train speeds through Uchumayo,
Tiabaya, and Tingo, the dreariness of the desert is forgotten in the
smiling gardens of the _campiña_, and when a curve of the road shows
Arequipa’s white towers against a background of green with the
snow-crowned Misti just behind, the traveller is ready to believe all
that enthusiasm relates in praise of its charm.

Mollendo, the seaport terminus of the Southern railway, is one of the
most important cities of the southern coast. As it lies within the arid
region, its water supply comes from the sierra eighty-five miles
distant, through an aqueduct made of iron pipes, from which half a
million gallons of water are discharged daily. This is said to be the
longest iron aqueduct in the world. The port of Mollendo is visited by
all ships trading on the west coast, and is the chief outlet for an
extensive region in Peru and northwestern Bolivia. In order to improve
the port, a breakwater is now being constructed along a reef of
partially submerged rocks, extending about six hundred feet to the
northeast of Ponce Island, which forms the harbor. This breakwater will
protect the bay from the heavy surf which formerly dashed over the
rocks, and will thus facilitate the working of the launches in loading
and unloading merchandise from the ships, besides increasing the
discharging capacity of the port. The breakwater consists of a sea wall
of concrete on the inner side of the reef, with heavy concrete blocks
weighing many tons, placed irregularly to seaward to break the force of
the surf. A new landing-place of iron and concrete is also to be
constructed.

[Illustration: RAILWAY UP THE SIERRA FROM MOLLENDO TO AREQUIPA.]

The railway from Mollendo to Arequipa reaches its highest altitude at
its destination, Arequipa being situated eight hundred feet above sea
level. From Arequipa to Puno the ascent is much greater, reaching
fifteen thousand feet at Crucero Alto, about midway along the route. The
first train from Arequipa to Puno arrived at the shore of Lake Titicaca
on the 1st of January, 1874. The cost of this railway was four and a
half million pounds sterling. Along its route are several bridges, and a
tunnel four hundred feet long pierces the mountain about thirty miles
east of Arequipa. As the train begins its ascent from Arequipa to
Juliaca, the city remains in view for several miles, and the white crest
of the Misti flashes in sight several times before it is hidden finally
behind the higher peaks of the sierra. After crossing the Chili River,
over a massive bridge sixteen hundred feet long and seventy feet above
the stream, the train makes a rapid run to Yura, fifteen miles distant,
where the most noted mineral springs of Peru are situated, a singularly
picturesque resort.

[Illustration: MOLLENDO, TERMINUS OF THE SOUTHERN RAILWAY.]

[Illustration: THE TOWN OF MOLLENDO.]

From Yura, the ascent soon brings one to the region of the _puna_, and
here very little vegetation is to be seen. Pampa de Arrieros is as bleak
and barren as a plateau at an altitude of thirteen thousand feet always
is; and the train speeds along for thirty miles with little change of
scene until it crosses the Sumbay bridge and climbs up to Vincocaya and
Crucero Alto. From Pampa de Arrieros, a magnificent view of the snow
mountain Coropuna is presented, this lofty peak towering nearly
twenty-three thousand feet above the level of the sea. The volcano
Ubinas comes into view a few leagues beyond Vincocaya, just before the
station of Lagunillas is reached. Lagunillas, or “Little Lagoons” is so
called from the lakes of Cachipascana and Saracocha, which lie on the
boundary line between the Departments of Arequipa and Puno, at an
altitude of thirteen thousand six hundred feet, more than a thousand
feet higher than Lake Titicaca. There are few signs of human activity at
the smaller railway stations of the _puna_, only a few cloaked figures
appearing on the platform as the train stops; but at the junction of
Juliaca the scene is one of animation, and many enterprising venders
congregate outside the car windows to sell their wares. The Indian
women, in their short skirts and _mantos_, or shawls, and their flat,
stiff-brimmed hats, present a curious spectacle to the foreign
traveller. Their dress is very sombre, in contrast to the bright colors
worn by the Indians of the lower sierra. In Puno, one sees both the
Aymará and the Quichua Indians, these two races meeting on the shores of
Lake Titicaca. The Aymarás are better sailors than their cousins of the
lower valleys, and the native boats, or balsas, that ply the lake are
usually owned by Aymará traders. The balsas are made of the reeds of
totora which are found on the banks of the lake, and are so lashed
together as to make the skiff water-tight and not easily capsized.

[Illustration: NEW RAILWAY BRIDGE AND OLD COACH ROAD BETWEEN SICUANI AND
CUZCO.]

A few months after the opening of the railway from Mollendo to Puno, two
screw steamers, the _Yavary_ and the _Yapura_, were launched for service
on the lake, having been brought out from England in pieces, which were
carried up to Puno with great difficulty and put together in the
company’s factory on the lake shore. New steamers have since been added;
the _Inca_ and _Coya_, recently launched, have a capacity of five
hundred tons, are lighted by electricity, and provide accommodations for
a hundred passengers. The voyage from Puno across to Guaqui, the
Bolivian port, is made in a day.

From Juliaca to Cuzco, the journey is one of constant and varied
interest. Nature presents many aspects in snow peaks and sloping
valleys, and on the plateau are to be seen herds of llamas and alpacas.
At the railway stations, groups of Indians offer for sale
curiously-shaped objects in pottery, and the brilliantly colored
blankets of this region. The jars, water-bottles, and ornaments which
they make are often highly glazed and wrought in unique fashion. Horses,
bearing cavaliers of the time of Charles V., in full armor, are favorite
ornaments, though there are also water-carriers and peddlers with packs
on their backs, and market women of wonderful dimensions. Most of these
articles are made to be useful as well as ornamental, serving as
water-bottles, toothpick-holders, match safes, etc. As works of art
these efforts are among the crudest, but they are made by the most
primitive process and represent much patience and industry. At Pucará,
these venders throng the station platform, Juliaca being more noted for
its blanket weavers. The Indians are very industrious, and whatever load
they may be carrying is never allowed to interfere with their spinning,
which goes on all the time, the bundles being strapped on their backs so
as to leave their arms free.

[Illustration: ANCIENT VIADUCT SOTOCCHACA, AYACUCHO.]

From Tirapata, the headquarters of the Inca Mining Company and an
important town of the plateau, the railway crosses a bridge and makes a
slight ascent to Ayaviri and Santa Rosa, and a steeper climb to La Raya,
which is the highest point between Juliaca and Cuzco. La Raya marks the
boundary between the Departments of Puno and Cuzco, and is also the
summit of the watershed which divides the Amazon system from that of
Lake Titicaca. It is situated at an altitude of fourteen thousand one
hundred and fifty feet above sea level. From La Raya, the train descends
rapidly to Aguas Calientes (hot springs), Marangani, and Sicuani, two
thousand five hundred feet lower, in the valley of the Vilcanota River.
Before the completion of the railway to Cuzco, a diligence carried
passengers from Sicuani to the ancient Inca capital, and, although the
modern method of travel is to be preferred for many reasons, there was
something charming in the drive along the old coach road that cannot be
enjoyed by the traveller who is being whirled over the route at railway
speed.

Formerly, the train arrived at Sicuani in the evening and passengers
spent the night in one of the quaintest and most interesting towns of
Peru, before taking the diligence to continue their journey to Cuzco.
The market place of Sicuani is a glow of color when the Indians fill it
with their wares. In the early morning they may be seen coming down the
mountain into the town, the men wearing a dress introduced by the
Spaniards during the time of the viceroyalty, with knee trousers and a
coat of the period of Louis XIV., the women gorgeous in their
_almillas_, or chemises of bright red or yellow; their _chamarras_,
jackets of bright blue or green velvet; their _chumpes_, many-colored
scarfs wound around their waists; and their flat, broad-brimmed hats
made of cloth, lined with red and covered with silver braid. They scurry
along the mountain road in high glee, their llamas in the lead with
heads erect and long straight ears adorned with tassels of red, yellow
and green woollen yarn. All the dignity of the procession is borne in
the stately carriage of the llamas, whose leisurely movements are never
disturbed by anything but fright.

[Illustration: RAILWAY ENGINEERS’ CAMP ON THE LINE BETWEEN CHECCACUPE
AND CUZCO.]

Since the railway has been opened to Cuzco, there is no longer any
necessity to break the journey between Sicuani and that city, as was
done in the days of the diligence, when a stop was made at Cusipata,
“the happy place,” after a wonderful ride along the valley of the
Vilcanota, crossing the Checcacupe River and revelling in scenes full of
historical interest and romantic charm. The second day’s ride used to
take one from Cusipata to Cuzco, past the ruins of Viracocha’s famous
temple, and close to the lake of Urcos, where, tradition says, the chain
of Huascar was buried when the Inca’s subjects learned that the
Spaniards were coming to Cuzco. This wonderful chain of gold, which is
said to have been long enough to enclose the plaza of Cuzco three times
and so heavy that each link weighed a hundred pounds, has been the
object of many expeditions to Urcos. Near this spot, Almagro and Pizarro
fought one of their bitterest battles, and in the neighborhood tradition
locates many victories of the Incas’ armies in earlier times.

The rope bridges formerly swung across the river have in many cases been
replaced by bridges of stone, though a few of the older construction
remain and are still strong and serviceable. Ruins of the ancient
aqueducts are to be seen, as well as the Incaic _andenes_ of the
mountain side. The road passes through deep gulches mantled with green
and under the shadow of sheer palisades towering a hundred feet above.
Rippling streams pour their silvery tide into the river that winds its
broadening course along the valley, and pepper trees, eucalyptus, furze
bushes six feet high, and prickly cactus, grow in profusion along the
roadside. The present railway follows closely the old diligence road.
From Urcos, a branch line has been surveyed to the port of
Tahuantinsuyo, on the Madre de Dios River, and another line is projected
to connect the city of Cuzco with Santa Ana, the capital of the province
of Convencion, in the same department. The immense importance of the
railway to Santa Ana lies in the facilities it will afford for traffic
in the region of the Montaña that is richest in coca and other valuable
products. The law authorizing the construction of this line, prepared by
Dr. Benjamin de La Torre, was passed by Congress in October, 1907, and
the work is to be completed in three years more.

[Illustration: HIGHWAY BETWEEN THE SIERRA AND THE MONTAÑA. IN THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUNÍN.]

Not only have the Central and Southern railways been extended and
supplemented with branch lines within the past four years, but nearly
all the existing railways of the republic have been brought to form
links in the general system which the government has planned for the
facilitation of traffic throughout the whole country. From the trunk
line,—which, when completed, will extend from the border of Ecuador in
the northwest to that of Bolivia in the southeast,—branches are being
built to the head of navigation on all the great waterways of the upper
Amazon. These lines will open up the vast region of the Montaña to the
ports of the Pacific, and will multiply the available resources of the
country a hundredfold. Products of the interior which have been cut off
from the consumers of the coast by the great wall of the Andes, will be
exchanged for goods brought to the Pacific ports; and months will be
saved in the transportation of articles required for household use in
the Amazon valleys. It will no longer be the custom for deputies from
Iquitos to travel to Lima by way of Europe and Panamá, as at present,
rather than across their own country, because the foreign trip takes
less time. One of these branch lines is that previously mentioned as
under construction to connect Urcos, on the Southern railway, with the
port of Tahuantinsuyo on the Madre de Dios; another is being built from
Oroya to the Ucayali River, passing through Tarma and along the present
road to the Pichis and Perené Rivers. It is to be completed in 1913. A
third line is entirely new, to be constructed from the port of Paita to
Puerto Limon on the Marañon River, with a branch to Puerto Yurimaguas on
the Huallaga.

[Illustration: VIEW OF THE VALLEY BETWEEN SICUANI AND CUZCO, SOUTHERN
ROUTE.]

All the railways projected and under construction to connect the Pacific
seaports of Peru with the Amazon tributaries are of political as well as
commercial importance, as they will serve to unite in closer bonds the
people of the coast, the sierra and the Montaña, hitherto so remote from
one another as to have few interests in common, except such as tradition
and sentiment have preserved.

The port of Paita offers many advantages as the Pacific terminus of a
railway to the Amazon waterways. From Paita to Puerto Limon the distance
is only four hundred miles, and from Puerto Limon to Pará it is nearly
three thousand miles. At present, most of the commerce of the Montaña is
carried down to Pará over the Amazon and its tributaries, and many of
the river routes are even longer than that from Puerto Limon. It is
estimated that the railways between the Pacific coast and the Amazon
will not only provide much more rapid transportation, but also a more
economical service.

The railways of the coast have been extended during the past four years
both longitudinally and in the direction of the sierra. From the port of
Tumbes a line was recently completed to La Palizada and the
landing-place of the port was improved by the construction of a steel
pier eight hundred feet in length. The Pacasmayo and Yonan railway has
been extended to Chilete and Cajamarca, to afford an outlet for the
cereals and other products grown in those sections of the sierra. From
Chimbote to Huaraz and Recuay one of the most important of the coast
railways has been built. A line is projected to run direct from Cerro de
Pasco to the coast, with its seaport terminus at Huacho, the concession
for its construction having been given to a North American capitalist.
An important new railway connects the port of Ilo with the city of
Moquegua; it was completed during the last months of President Pardo’s
administration. Along the shore of the Pacific, a railway has recently
been completed from Lima to Huacho on the north, and another is under
construction from the capital to Pisco in the south.

Not only has railway construction received a great impetus under the
energetic and progressive government of the past few years, but the
public roads of the country have been extended and improved, new bridges
have been built, new wharves constructed in several ports, and greater
attention paid to commercial facilities than ever before.

                              CHAPTER XXIX
     PASTURE LANDS OF THE PLATEAU—THE ALPACA AND THE VICUÑA OF PUNO


[Illustration: A NATIVE FAMILY OF THE PUNA.]

The extension of railways in Peru is destined to aid greatly in the
development of one of the most promising industries of the country, the
raising of cattle, sheep, alpacas, and other live stock. On the high
tablelands of Cajamarca, Junín, Ayacucho, and Puno, and in the upper
valleys of Cuzco, the climate and pasturage are particularly adapted to
cattle-farming and to the production of a hardy kind of sheep, easily
cared for and capable of great improvement under scientific culture. The
difficulties of transportation formerly interfered with success in
cattle-raising; but, with the building of new railways that furnish
facilities in shipping the cattle, hides, and wool from the interior,
this industry has received great encouragement and is now in a more
thriving condition than ever before. Some of the large ranges of the
plateau cover an area of more than a hundred square miles and afford
pasturage for twenty-five thousand head of cattle. On the plains of
Puno, thousands of cattle, sheep, and alpaca are pastured, the wool
industry receiving especial attention in this department, which may be
called the “wool-growing state” of Peru.

The cattle of Cajamarca, La Libertad, Ancash, Junín, Lima, and Arequipa
are the best, as in these regions there is abundance of lucerne, grass,
sorghum, and other good pasturage. In these departments, also, the
native stock has been improved by crossing with foreign varieties,
imported for the purpose. The criollo cattle, the result of
cross-breeding, are a fine race, and good for dairy purposes, cows
giving as much as three or four gallons of milk daily. The imported
cattle usually belong to well-known European stock, chiefly the
Holstein, Brown Swiss, Ayrshire, Devon, and Jersey varieties. The
Sociedad Ganadera de Junín is doing much to raise the standard of cattle
culture in that department, and is establishing dairies for the
manufacture of butter, cheese, and other products, which are now largely
imported from Europe. On some of the sheep farms the ewe’s milk is used
in making a very fine quality of cheese, and it is believed that this
industry may be so developed as to compete with the famous Roquefort
cheese.

[Illustration: THE PRINCIPAL PLAZA OF PUNO.]

Nearly all the native live stock of Peru is of Spanish origin, the first
horses, cattle, and sheep having been imported at the time of the
Conquest. The llama, alpaca, and vicuña are, of course, of Andean
origin. The Peruvian horses are descendants of the Arab stock, the best
specimens being reared on the coast, though there is ample opportunity
for increasing both the quality and the number of good horses in the
inter-Andean region, and, especially, on the higher slopes of the
Montaña. The government is devoting considerable attention to the
improvement of the live stock of the country, the National Society of
Agriculture stimulating endeavor in this direction by competitive
exhibitions.

The live stock farms show the effects of progressive enterprise. The
Atocsaico hacienda, covering eighteen square leagues on the plateau of
Junín, has fourteen leagues enclosed in wire fences, and is provided
with many modern conveniences. The administration house is a commodious
dwelling built of wood and lined with zinc, besides which there are
outhouses, storerooms, and stables, and a small hydraulic press. The
hacienda also has corrals and a bathing place for the sheep, built
according to the Australian system, a tank of concrete for the water and
iron apparatus arranged over an oven for heating water and preparing the
bath. Ten Scotch shepherds are employed, and they are well paid, having
houses provided for them, with some of their food supplies, besides good
monthly wages. The Scotch collie accompanies his master, and, in
addition to ten of these dogs, three Scotch greyhounds are kept; all the
dogs are provided with comfortable kennels. Another farm of the same
region, the Castaneda hacienda, has a fine dairy and a tannery
completely equipped for the treatment of all kinds of skins. There is a
large field in Peru for the tanning industry, which is still in the
infancy of development.

The native sheep of the plateau are of small stature, long-legged,
thick-skinned, and have a rough and scanty fleece; but when this _puna_
variety is crossed with the imported merino sheep, the criollo offspring
are larger, not so thick-skinned and have abundant wool of a much
curlier and finer quality. The shearing takes place annually, the
production being from five to eight pounds of wool per head, according
to the age of the sheep and the kind of pasture. The most important
wool-growing industry is that of the plateaus on which the llama, alpaca
and vicuña have their haunts.

[Illustration: SHEEP ON THE PASTURES OF ANCASH.]

The Department of Puno is particularly noted for its alpacas, which have
remarkably heavy fleeces of great length. The alpaca is sheared every
two years and gives from six to nine pounds of wool, the best quality
being that of the fleece taken from the animal when three or four years
old. The wool of the llama is much coarser, and that of the vicuña a
great deal finer, than the alpaca’s wool. The llama, sometimes called
the “camel of the Andes,” is chiefly valued as a beast of burden, while
neither the alpaca nor the vicuña is employed in this way. The alpaca, a
smaller animal than the llama, and more stockily built, is usually brown
or black in color, has shorter legs and carries itself with less stately
dignity than the prouder llama, which seldom curves its long neck,
holding its head high and turning it from side to side with a leisurely
movement, as it strides along with slow, measured tread. The llama,
alpaca, and vicuña are best understood and most easily managed by native
Indian shepherds, who seldom have any trouble in leading them wherever
they will. The Indian never treats his pastoral charge with cruelty, and
his methods are distinguished by that nonchalance and abundant leisure
which seem to be his most marked characteristics. The vicuña produces
less wool than either the llama or the alpaca, but its fleece is of a
much finer quality, which brings better prices in the European market.
Peru exports annually about four million pounds of wool.

[Illustration: LLAMAS GRAZING ON THE PUNA.]

The culture of vicuña wool deserves especial attention as it is one of
the most lucrative industries of the country, and, with intelligent and
persevering devotion to its interests, may be developed far beyond its
present condition. The existence of the vicuña in Peru dates back to
pre-Columbian times, when it was a favorite offering of the Incas in
sacrifice to the God of the Sun at the great feast of Raymi. The
Spaniards gave it the name of “carneiro de tierra,” or land sheep; and
naturalists who travelled in Peru during the time of the viceroyalty
classified it as belonging to the camel family.

The vicuña stands from three to four feet in height and has a long
slender neck on which is set a small, rather delicately-shaped head with
narrow pointed ears that stand upright; the body is about three or four
feet in length, and the legs are long and very slender, the hind legs
being longer than those in front, which is an advantage to the animal in
its mountain climbing. The fleece is a delicate light tan color, darker
on the back than elsewhere, the coat showing light under the body and on
the inside of the legs, where it is almost white. The vicuña has no
horns and its chief defense is the same as that of the llama, which
shows displeasure by spitting at the offending object. Almost as soon as
born, at least within a few hours after making its entrance into the
world, this remarkable little animal is ready to follow its mother on a
long and tiring run, and by the second day it will show wonderful
strength and velocity in keeping up with the older one, especially if
they are fleeing from pursuers.

[Illustration: ARCHED GATEWAY OF PUNO.]

Only in a very limited region of the Andes is the vicuña to be found,
chiefly in Peru and Bolivia, where it seeks the highest parts of the
sierra at an altitude of from ten thousand to fifteen thousand feet
above sea level, in a region where the temperature is below freezing
point. An interesting description of the vicuña’s habits is given by a
Peruvian writer, Señor G. Gutierrez Madueno, who has made a careful
study of this animal. He says that as soon as a family of young vicuñas
are full grown,—that is, when ten months or a year old,—the females make
such an onslaught on their brothers, kicking and biting them, that the
latter are forced to leave the maternal shelter and go elsewhere, either
to form their own ménage in an Adam’s paradise, or to seek mates in
other homes and establish new relations. In any case, not more than one
male is permitted in a herd, which used to number as many as fifty
females, though few are now seen to have more than twenty. The chosen
male always leads the herd, keeping a certain distance ahead so as to
warn them of any approaching danger; this he does by making a curious
sound, at which his followers retreat to a safe distance, usually up the
cliffs, from which they can look down on the intruder and satisfy their
curiosity. If a hunter kills the male, the entire herd surrounds the
dead body in an effort to resuscitate it, manifesting every sign of
grief; if, on the contrary, one of the females is killed, it is left to
its fate, while the survivors make all speed to a place of safety.

On the high plains and sierras of Puno the hunting of the alpaca and the
vicuña for their wool has been active ever since colonial days, though
it is only within recent years that the necessity for protecting this
important source of wealth has occupied the attention of the
authorities. The government is now thoroughly awakened to the danger
threatened by a constant and reckless destruction of these valuable
wool-bearing animals, and laws have been adopted looking to their
preservation. The city of Puno, founded by the Viceroy the Count of
Lemos in the seventeenth century, is the central market and shipping
point for the alpaca and vicuña wool of a large territory, and in the
museum of the city are to be seen some rare specimens of beautiful
textiles woven from these products.

The city of Puno lies on the border of Lake Titicaca, overlooking that
picturesque body of water more than twelve thousand five hundred feet
above the sea. It is an interesting town, with its great central plaza,
its fine old churches, and the handsome stone arch gateway that was
built under the viceroyalty. A statue in the plaza honors the memory of
a brave patriot who exchanged his judicial robes for the uniform of a
soldier and fell fighting for his country in the last war. The hospital
and orphanage of San Juan de Dios, founded more than thirty years ago by
the Benevolent Society, looks like a haven of comfort, surrounded by
pretty flower gardens and directed by sweet-faced Sisters of Charity.
The national college of San Carlos represents the city’s advancement in
educational matters, its curriculum embracing practical as well as
theoretical instruction. Puno has archæological interests also as it
lies in the centre of a district in which are found stone monuments of
great antiquity. Sallustani is the most famous of these ruins, with a
round tower of unknown origin.

                              CHAPTER XXX
                    CUZCO, THE ANCIENT INCA CAPITAL


[Illustration: ANCIENT ADOBE ARCHWAY NEAR CUZCO.]

As the Imperial City of the Children of the Sun, Cuzco was, four
centuries ago, the metropolis of a vast domain, greater in extent and
richer in treasure than most civilized countries of its day. Few
capitals rivalled the chief city of the Incas in wealth and population
at the time of the Spanish invasion, when, with its rural environs that
stretched out for leagues in every direction, it numbered two hundred
thousand inhabitants, and was the centre of religious and social
influence in all Peru. Every subject of the Inca looked toward Cuzco
with pride and reverence, glorying in its palaces and temples and
bringing tribute to its sovereigns from the remotest provinces, in
adoration of the royal grandeur and power. Gold, silver, precious
stones, and fine textiles were constantly added to the storehouse of
treasure which the sacred city guarded as the divine right of its
princes. No wealth was ever permitted to leave its precincts. It is no
wonder that the Spaniards were amazed at the magnificence of its temples
and the abundance of its treasure. For centuries, the contributions had
accumulated, and with each succeeding emperor the splendor of the royal
palaces was enhanced by new gifts, and the golden disks in the Sun
temples grew larger and of finer workmanship.

[Illustration: A FEAST DAY CELEBRATION, SHOWING THE UNIVERSITY AND THE
JESUITS’ CHURCH, CUZCO.]

It is impossible to visit Cuzco without finding its wonderful stone
walls and ancient ruins objects of increasing interest and curiosity.
Every street and alley tells a story of Inca days, old walls of Incaic
architecture forming the base of many of the modern edifices. In Cuzco
more than in any other city of the New World, the ancient landmarks have
been preserved in the midst of modern changes. The Temple of the Sun and
the great fortress of Sacsahuaman, “the Capitol and Coliseum of Peruvian
Rome,” still present interesting features to the sightseer,
notwithstanding the vandalism of the Conquerors and the destructive
elements of time. Not only is the convent of Santo Domingo built on the
foundation walls of the ancient Coricancha,—the greatest and richest of
all the temples of Inca worship,—but a Christian altar occupies the very
place where the sacred emblem of the Sun god was guarded by the high
priests of Tahuantinsuyo, and the cells of the convent of Santa Catalina
are the same chambers that were once reserved for the Virgins of the
Sun. The cloister of Santo Domingo is formed of massive stone columns,
which support a beautifully carved archway surrounding the _patio_ or
inner garden of the convent. This was one of the first edifices built by
the Spaniards in Peru; and a short distance away is the historic spot
where the Conquerors formed their quartel and took refuge when
overpowered by the superior numbers of the Indians. Tradition relates
that, on one occasion, the Spaniards were besieged in this entrenchment,
and were about to perish,—the Indians having set fire to the
defences,—when the Virgin Mary descended in a cloud to their relief,
accompanied by the patron saint of Spain, Saint James, or “Santiago,” on
a white horse. By this divine interposition, the flames were
extinguished and victory rewarded the brave propagators of the faith.
The cathedral was erected near this spot, one of its chapels, called
“Our Lady of the Triumph,” serving to commemorate this miracle.

[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE JESUITS’ CHURCH, CUZCO.]

The old churches and other structures of colonial times are as
interesting in their way as the remains of Incaic architecture, and
Cuzco is full of reminiscences of the viceroyalty. The cathedral, built
in the style of the Renaissance, was begun soon after the Conquest, and
was not completed until ninety years later, in the middle of the
seventeenth century. It is of stone and the cost of construction was so
great that one of the viceroys remarked “it would have been less
expensive in silver.” The interior consists of three naves, separated by
stone pillars which support high, vaulted arches; in the central nave is
the choir, the carving of which is superb; and in front of it stands the
high altar, covered with silver. Two organs fill the church with the
music of their rich tones on Sundays and feast days. The cathedral has
many paintings, one of which, _El Señor de la Agonia_, is a masterpiece,
said to be an original Van Dyck. In the sacristy are portraits of the
popes and of all the bishops of Cuzco. One of the most precious
possessions of the cathedral is the monstrance, which is ornamented with
pearls, diamonds, emeralds, rubies and other precious stones of great
value. In the naves to the right and left of the main entrance to the
cathedral are chapels dedicated to the images of the Virgin, our Lord
and the Saints, worshipped in special commemoration of some miracle. The
Indians are particularly devoted to _Our Lord of the Earthquakes_,
represented by an image that is blackened with the smoke of candles that
have been placed on the altar by innumerable worshippers. It is not
unusual to see the space in front of this chapel occupied by a group of
Indians on their knees, gazing in adoration on the image of _El Señor de
los Temblores_, whom they regard as their especial protector. Their
religious processions in his honor are held on Monday of Holy Week and
are attended by an immense concourse.

[Illustration: THE PREFECTURE, CUZCO.]

The signal for beginning a religious procession in Cuzco is given by the
ringing of the great bell of the cathedral, the “Maria Angola,” one of
the richest and clearest-toned bells in the world. The history of the
“Maria Angola” is interesting. It is named in honor of a pious lady of
Cuzco who gave three hundred pounds’ weight of gold to be used in
casting it. This enormous bell, which is large enough to cover a group
of eight men, was cast in the city of Cuzco in 1659. An inclined plane
had to be built from the cathedral tower to the street in order to raise
the colossal piece of bronze to its place, and the task required the
employment of a host of workmen. The prevailing controversy of the time
when the bell was made is indicated by the words engraved on its border:
_Ora pro nobis, Alabada sea el Santisimo Sacramento del Altar y la
Purisima Conception de Nuestra Señora, sin pecado original_ [“Pray for
us; Glory be to the most holy sacrament of the Altar and the most pure
conception of Our Lady, without original sin.”] The rich, sonorous tones
of the “Maria Angola” may be heard twenty-five miles away from Cuzco,
and the music is most beautiful and potent to incline one to a spirit of
reverence. When its clear tones announce the elevation of the Host, the
venders in the market place fall on their knees and the business of
buying and selling is suspended while the solemn voice from the
cathedral tower calls to a more sacred duty. It is said that the soft,
vibrant tone of the “Maria Angola” bell is due to the great amount of
gold in its composition.

[Illustration: CALLE MARQUEZ, CUZCO.]

When one visits the chief places of interest in Cuzco, there is so much
to be seen that it is customary to divide the time so as to make
separate excursions to the Incaic ruins, the old colonial churches and
palaces, and finally to the places where modern enterprise is to be
seen. A day among the wonders of Sacsahuaman, the Rodadero, the ancient
walls of Pachacutec’s palace, the house once occupied by an Inca
“medicine man” (easily recognized by the seven serpents carved in relief
on the façade), the narrow alleys with their curious legends, is
sufficient to inspire enthusiasm for a trip to the neighboring town of
Pisac, where it is possible to climb the mountain to the observatory of
Inti-Huatana and spend interesting hours in speculation as to the uses
the Incas made of the edifice that once topped this almost inaccessible
eminence. Still more fascinating are the ruins of Ollantaytambo, which
lie a few leagues north of Cuzco, the site of stupendous monuments of
Incaic architecture, and once the favorite summer residence of the
sovereigns of Cuzco. From the height of its walls, the prospect sweeps
to the far horizon, following the beautiful Urubamba valley, or narrows
to right and left where high mountains shut out a larger view. Far up
the sides of these towering cliffs the Incas’ subjects were buried in
caverns hollowed out like swallows’ nests, the openings being covered
over with earth to hide their sepulchre. It is not known where the
bodies of the Incas themselves were hidden when they were taken from the
Temple of the Sun at the approach of the Spaniards. A great treasure
awaits the discoverer, for it is said that when an emperor died his body
was embalmed and placed in the Temple of the Sun on a throne of gold;
both the golden thrones and their occupants disappeared with the advent
of the Conquerors and they have never been found.

[Illustration: THE UNIVERSITY OF CUZCO.]

On the site of the Church of the Compañia, or the Jesuits’ church, in
the Plaza Matriz, once stood the palace of the Inca Huayna-Ccapac in the
midst of gardens that covered the area now occupied by the church and
the neighboring University of Cuzco. The three plazas now known as
Matriz, Regocijo, and San Francisco, then formed a single large square,
in which were celebrated the grand public festivals dedicated to the
Sun; it was this large square which was encircled by the celebrated gold
chain of Huascar. None of the convents and churches built during the
viceroyalty show greater architectural beauty than the Compañia. The
interior is cruciform, has a single broad nave, whose massive stone
pillars are of varied design, some round and others square, with Doric
capital on which rest the great arches that are the most imposing
features of its architecture. A large dome, supported on four arches of
beautiful design, marks the division of the cross where the nave is met
by transverse aisles, and on the face of this rotunda is sculptured the
coat-of-arms of the Company of Jesus, in elaborate design.

[Illustration: VENDERS IN THE ARCADE, CUZCO.]

Though the interior of the Compañia is a magnificent example of the
church architecture of Cuzco, the cloister of Merced is also much to be
admired, with its superb arches on the upper and lower galleries
surrounding the _patio_, and its wonderful staircases made of blocks of
black granite. The cloister itself is built of stone taken from the
fortress of Sacsahuaman, the architecture being of the seventeenth
century, Greco-Roman in style. Cuzco has also, in the parochial church
of San Blas, one of the handsomest pulpits in existence, a superb
specimen of the finest wood-carving of the seventeenth century.

The Cuzco of the Incas and the viceroyalty is so absorbing in interest
that the modern city must pay the penalty of past fame by a harder
struggle for present recognition than new cities have to experience.
When a town springs up under the impulse of modern enterprise, every
feature of its growth and development is noted; but when it has “a
history,” the greatest effort is necessary to win even a passing comment
on its present condition. Cuzco has made notable progress within the
past few years and is constantly improving in social and industrial
development. When President José Pardo visited the city in 1905, he was
impressed by the favorable outlook for this section of the republic,
destined to be one of the richest industrial centres of South America.

The city of Cuzco, capital of the department of the same name, occupies
a central position in southern Peru. It lies in the valley of the
Urubamba River, on the banks of the Huatanay, at an altitude of nearly
twelve thousand feet above sea level. To the south and west are the
plateaus and sierras of the highest Cordilleras, while to the north and
east the country slopes rapidly to the region of the Montaña, with its
virgin forests and intermingling waterways.

The city of Cuzco is lighted with electricity, and has a complete system
of waterworks, recently installed, which ensures an abundance of water
for all purposes, and provides the means for improving the sanitation of
the city and rendering it a more desirable place of residence. Formerly
the lack of a sufficient water supply made it impossible for the
authorities to enforce hygienic measures of the greatest importance; but
now that this difficulty has been removed, Cuzco is making its streets
clean and its plazas beautiful. The water is brought down from
neighboring springs ten miles distant, by means of aqueducts and pipes,
the old Spanish aqueduct being also utilized for the purpose. From a
reservoir of masonry, with a capacity of three thousand cubic metres,
the water is distributed at the rate of three hundred gallons a second.

New telegraph and telephone lines connect Cuzco with other cities of the
department, long distance wires having been established between the
capital and Paucartambo, Abancay, and other points, in addition to the
national telegraph lines. New public buildings have been constructed
during the present administration, and improvements have been made in
many institutions. The Prefecture, which occupies the site where Pizarro
lived when in Cuzco, was remodelled and beautified a short time ago.

Public instruction has received greater attention within the past few
years than ever before, and, from the primary school to the university,
the tendency is in favor of special training with a view to its
practical uses. The University of Cuzco is one of the oldest educational
institutions of Peru, and in its cloisters some of the most noted
Peruvian scholars found inspiration. Cuzco was the birthplace of the
great historian of the Incas, Garcilaso de la Vega, and of the learned
writers Castro, Espinoza Medrano, Heras; Perez, who was called “the
bishop of epigrams,” Leonardo Villar, a famous physician and scholar;
Antonio Lorena, the anthropologist; David Matto, learned in
bacteriology; Narciso Arestegui, the novelist; as well as the military
leaders, General Gamarra, La Puerta, and many others who were proud to
claim the old Inca capital as their native city.

In the new era of progress on which Peru has entered with so much
promise, the ancient Cuzco, that was held in reverence as the “centre of
the universe” ages before America was discovered by the European, will
hold its own among its more modern sister cities. The treasure of its
ancient ruins but adds interest to a city that knows how to keep in line
with the march of modern civilization.

                              CHAPTER XXXI
        THE MONTAÑA AND ITS PRODUCTS—THE RUBBER LANDS OF LORETO


[Illustration: INDIANS CARRYING COCA TO MARKET.]

The region of the Montaña lies chiefly in the Amazon plain, where the
rubber trees and hardwoods of commerce grow in abundance, though on its
western and southern border it extends to the slope of the Cordilleras,
covering a territory rich in agricultural production. The northern
provinces of Puno and Cuzco and the eastern provinces of Junín and
Huánuco, as well as the entire Departments of San Martin, Amazonas, and
Loreto, belong to the region of the Montaña. Much of this vast territory
has never been cultivated, and a great deal of it remains to be
explored. It is richer in natural resources than any other part of Peru,
and, with the exception of the lower wooded region of the rubber
country, where malaria and anemia prevail, the climate is healthful.

The Montaña really comprises two separate regions, the high woodlands of
the eastern Andean slopes and the level lands that stretch away from
their base to the northeastern boundary of the republic. The high
woodlands have a mild cool climate, similar to that of southern Europe,
and their altitude renders them free from the diseases usually prevalent
in a tropical country. This part of the Montaña is a veritable paradise,
luxuriant in vegetation and marvellously productive. The chief drawback
to its industrial development has hitherto been the difficulty of
transporting its products to market, owing to the lack of railway
facilities. Now that this obstacle is rapidly being removed, there is
every reason to expect a greatly increased development of the
agricultural wealth of the Montaña, which is an especially promising
field for immigration.

The natural resources of the Montaña include many plants, fruits, and
herbs not found in other countries. In the warm valleys and on the
eastern slopes of the Cordilleras, at an altitude of from two thousand
to five thousand feet above sea level, the coca plant grows in
abundance. It is a native of Peru and Bolivia and has not been
cultivated successfully in any other part of the world, except to a
small extent in Ecuador and Colombia. From this plant is manufactured
the well-known drug, cocaine, used so generally for medicinal and
surgical purposes. Its leaves are the Indian’s most cherished
consolation; he will perform wonderful feats of endurance if provided
with a small sack of these, which he chews as the Oriental does the
betel, mixing them with a kind of lime which greatly increases the
stimulating effect.

[Illustration: CANOEING ON THE HUALLAGA RIVER.]

The Peruvian Indian eats little and yet, by chewing coca leaves, he is
able to make long journeys on foot or to do hard work in the fields and
in the mines without fatigue. The effect of the excessive use of this
stimulant is very harmful, dulling the mental faculties and, in extreme
cases, causing paralysis. Used in moderation, it seems to produce no bad
effects, and has even been recommended for soldiers on the march, who
are exposed to fatigue and all kinds of weather. When taken as a hot
tea, coca excites perspiration; and it acts as a sedative in asthmatic
attacks. The leaves are used for cataplasms in relieving rheumatic
pains. The curative effects following the use of this drug are so
numerous that it is regarded by the Indians as a panacea for all ills.
When the Spaniards first arrived in Peru, they were unable to account
for the wonderful properties of the coca plant, and in superstitious
fear they prohibited its cultivation, believing it to be an instrument
of the devil.

The best locality for the growth of the coca plant is in warm valleys,
not more than five thousand feet above the sea, where the average
temperature is between fifty and eighty degrees Fahrenheit, and the land
is clayey, abundant in iron, and without the presence of salts of any
kind; the ground must be soft and loose, and is best on the hillside,
where the water of the rains is quickly carried off and does not leave
the soil too damp, though frequent rains are desirable to promote rapid
and leafy growth. The first harvest is gathered eighteen months after
planting, and great care is required in collecting the leaves, so that
the shrub may not be injured. Each leaf is picked separately and dropped
on a cloth, spread on the ground for the purpose, only the top leaves
being left on the plant to prevent its dying off. As a rule, three or
four crops are harvested every year, the most productive coca
plantations being in the Departments of Cuzco, Huánuco, Junín, and the
inter-Andean valleys of La Libertad. The province of Urubamba, in the
Department of Cuzco, is famous for the abundance and fine quality of its
coca, the plant growing here to a maximum height of about six feet. The
only coca plantations of importance on the coast slope of the
Cordilleras are those of the province of Yauyos, in the Department of
Lima.

A Peruvian scientist, Dr. Hipólito Unánue, was the first to make a
thorough study of the constituent properties of the coca leaf; and, in
1859, an Austrian chemist, Albert Niemann, extracted from coca leaves
the alkaloid known as cocaine, which is now manufactured in Peru, as
well as in other countries. A great deal of the coca produced on the
various plantations is consumed in the country, the average Indian
chewing from fifteen to twenty grammes daily. In the native factories,
each pound of leaves yields from three to four grammes of cocaine. The
exportation of coca leaves amounts annually to upwards of three million
pounds, and that of the manufactured product, cocaine, to about fifteen
thousand pounds. The leaves are employed, in Europe and the United
States, not only for the manufacture of cocaine, cocaidine, and other
alkaloids, but in the making of wines, tonics, and refreshing drinks of
various kinds.

[Illustration: SHIPYARD AT ASTILLERO, WHERE THE INCA MINING COMPANY’S
FIRST STEAMER WAS BUILT.]

Another product of the Peruvian Montaña, cacao, promises to be an
important source of revenue when the industry is better developed. The
cacao trees of Cuzco produce a chocolate of exceptional quality and a
delicious cocoa, the fruit being especially rich and possessing the
properties required in chocolate of the best taste and finest aroma. But
none of the Cuzco cacao ever gets into the foreign market, as it is all
consumed in Peru. The cacao tree grows spontaneously in many districts
of the Montaña, and requires little cultivation to make it yield in
abundance. Wherever cacao orchards have been planted, the results have
been eminently satisfactory, and every year sees an increase of cacao
plantations, chiefly in the region of Chanchamayo, in the province of
Jaen, Department of Cajamarca, and in the lower provinces of Amazonas
and San Martin. The future of the cacao industry is particularly
promising, and no other enterprise offers greater reward for the slight
labor invested, as the trees, once planted, continue to bear for a
hundred years, requiring no other labor than the gathering of the
harvest.

[Illustration: CHICAPLAYA, IN THE HEART OF THE MONTAÑA.]

The largest coffee plantations of Peru are cultivated in the region of
the Montaña, though the coffees of Pacasmayo, on the coast, and of
Choquisongo, in the sierra, are of excellent quality. Carabaya, in the
Department of Puno, produces some of the best coffee known, the Carabaya
bean being particularly rich in caffeine. Chanchamayo is also an
important coffee-producing centre, more than five million trees growing
on the haciendas of this district, in the province of Tarma, Department
of Junín. In one colony alone are thirty-five coffee plantations,
covering seventeen hundred acres, on which two million trees are
cultivated. The plantations are being improved every year, and there is,
apparently, no reason why Peru should not be among the leading
coffee-growing countries of the world. At present, a little more than a
thousand tons are exported annually, after the home market is supplied,
as Peru imports no coffee of any kind.

All the agricultural products that flourish on the coast, and many of
those that are cultivated on the sierra, may be grown with success in
the Montaña. Sugar, rice, tobacco, maize, and even wheat, barley, and
potatoes, thrive in some of the provinces of Cuzco, Junín, and other
interior departments. Tobacco is grown in all the provinces of the
Montaña, including those of the Department of Loreto, which lies almost
entirely in the Amazon plain. The cultivation of tobacco is carried on
in the most primitive fashion, and the plantations do not yield what
they are capable of producing under more scientific methods.

[Illustration: CHUNCHO INDIANS OF THE PENEDO VALLEY.]

The most important industry of the lower Montaña is rubber-gathering,
the forests of the vast Amazon plain abounding in these trees of
ever-increasing commercial value. The _jebe_, or _seringa_, as it is
called in Brazil, known abroad as Pará rubber, grows best in the low
lands of Loreto, where the altitude does not exceed three hundred feet,
and where abundant rains and an equatorial climate cause the warm
humidity necessary to the production of the latex, or milk, of the
rubber tree. The _jebe_ grows to an average height of seventy-five feet,
the leaves forming a tuft of green at the top; the trunk is of
cylindrical shape, often measuring six or seven feet in diameter near
the base. The quality of the latex is known by its color, the best being
of a violet grey hue while the inferior latex is much lighter. The
rubber trees grow sometimes in groups of eight or ten together, and
again singly, at intervals of from sixty to two hundred feet apart. A
_jebe_ property is usually defined by _estradas_, or paths, leading past
a number of rubber trees, the average _estrada_ embracing an area of a
hundred acres, more or less, in which are from a hundred to a hundred
and fifty trees, yielding rubber. One man is usually employed on each
_estrada_, and his day’s work consists in tapping the trees in the early
morning by notching a place with a hatchet and fixing in it a _tichela_,
or little tin cup, to receive the latex, as it oozes out of the cut.
When he has made his round, he returns to collect the latex, emptying
the contents of the _tichela_ into a pail, which he carries to his camp
to be smoked in preparation for its shipment. The process of “smoking,”
or coagulation, consists in twirling the latex around a ladle that is
held over the smoke of burning wood, the hard wood known as vegetable
marble being best suited to this purpose. The _seringuero_, as this
class of rubber gatherer is called, collects upward of twenty-five
pounds of rubber a year from each tree in the forests of Loreto,
northern Cuzco and the region of the Madre de Dios.

[Illustration: MASISEA, THE FIRST WIRELESS TELEGRAPH STATION BUILT
BETWEEN PUERTO BERMUDEZ AND IQUITOS.]

Besides the _jebe_, or Pará rubber, the forests of the Montaña yield
great quantities of the variety called _caucho_, which is gathered in
regions where the heat and humidity are not so great as in the _seringa_
lands. The _cauchero_ works on a plan different from that of the
_seringuero_; if he is collecting _caucho_ in _planchas_, or slabs, he
fells the tree near a hole made for the purpose of receiving the latex
as it flows, and then he mixes this fluid with common soap, or an
infusion of vetilla, to bring about coagulation; if he wishes to extract
the _sernambi de caucho_, which is of greater value than the _plancha_,
his method is to bleed the tree by cutting deep gashes in it with his
_machete_, or hatchet, and leaving the milk to flow in little canals,
artificially prepared to conduct the latex, which becomes coagulated on
exposure to the air and forms ribbons of rubber, that are rolled into
balls and shipped in this form. Each tree furnishes, on an average,
about fifty pounds of _caucho_. A moderate duty is levied on the
exportation of all rubber, _jebe_ paying a cent and a half, gold, a
pound, and _caucho_ a cent a pound; this rate is only about one-fifth of
the export duty charged in Brazil, and one-half that in Bolivia.

[Illustration: A TURBULENT TRIBUTARY OF THE MADRE DE DIOS RIVER.]

Foreign enterprise has done a great deal in developing the rubber
industry in Peru, the government making liberal concessions to those who
purchase rubber lands for exploitation. Tracts of virgin woodland in the
Montaña are sold at the rate of a dollar an acre, and grants are made
under liberal conditions; a number of acres of land, supposed to contain
rubber trees, or a number of _estradas_, may be rented by paying one
dollar for every hundred pounds of rubber extracted, the destruction of
the trees being forbidden. The Inca Rubber Company is one of the most
important foreign enterprises in the Montaña. This company was the
outgrowth of a concession granted by the Peruvian government to Chester
W. Brown, of the Inca Mining Company, for certain lands located in the
Montaña, in the Department of Puno. The government ceded to the company
eight thousand acres of land for every mile of road opened to public
traffic between the Santo Domingo mine and the Madre de Dios River, or a
navigable point on the Tambopata, the road to be approximately seven
feet wide, with a maximum grade of ten per cent and to afford all the
conditions necessary for the safe and comfortable transportation of
passengers and freight. Not only has the road been completed through the
rich rubber lands between the Inambari and Tambopata Rivers to the head
of navigation at Astillero station, but a steamer, the _Inca_, has been
built to connect this port with Riberalta and, by means of the San
Antonio railway—now under construction in accordance with the Acre
treaty between Bolivia and Brazil—with the Madeira and Amazon to the
Atlantic Ocean. The completion of the Inca Rubber Company’s road ensures
an outlet to the Atlantic by a short route from the Pacific, as the
Southern railway connects the Pacific port of Mollendo with the station
of Tirapata, whence the road is built to Santo Domingo, Puerto Candamo,
and Astillero. From Tirapata to Astillero, the distance is two hundred
and eighty miles through a rich rubber country. Over this long distance,
the steamer _Inca_ was brought in pieces, carried on the backs of
Indians, to the company’s shipyard, for which the port is named,
“Astillero” meaning “shipyard.” Here it was built and launched on the
Tambopata. A telephone connects Astillero with Santo Domingo and
Tirapata, and electricity is used in lighting the town. Explorations
have been made in this region by Mr. Brown and Professor Baily, of
Harvard University, and the Wilson River was discovered by an explorer
sent out at the Inca Rubber Company’s expense.

[Illustration: A RUBBER CAMP IN THE MONTAÑA.]

[Illustration: RAPIDS ON THE TAMBOPATA RIVER.]

[Illustration: A TYPICAL SCENE ON THE WATERWAYS OF THE UPPER AMAZON.]

The success of the Inca Rubber Company has attracted other investors to
the Montaña, and, within the past two years, several similar enterprises
have been inaugurated. The Inambari Pará Rubber States Company, Limited,
was formed a year ago with a capital of three hundred and fifty thousand
pounds, to exploit the rubber of the province of Carabaya; the
Paucartambo Rubber Company, Limited, has started an enterprise in the
Madre de Dios region; the Compañia Gomera Alto Marañon recently began
the development of the rubber industry in the Department of Amazonas,
and the Sociedad Madre de Dios has begun to work the forests of the
eastern rubber district. With the increased output of rubber promised by
the successful exploitation of these properties, the annual revenue
derived from this source will undoubtedly show rapid gain. The financial
crisis which affected the North American market in 1907 was severely
felt in the rubber trade of the Amazon region, the shipments of this
product being cut down to an alarmingly low quantity. The new
enterprises felt the disastrous conditions most keenly, though all the
rubber establishments of the Amazon country suffered greatly. The loss
was heavy also to those merchants who depend on the success of the
rubber trade for their prosperity. In Iquitos, as well as in the ports
of the lower Amazon, the whole business atmosphere was pervaded with
gloom for a time; though it was understood that the depression could
only be temporary, as the demand for rubber is constantly increasing,
and the purposes for which it may be employed appear to be of an almost
unlimited variety. A passing money crisis is not sufficient to imperil
the interests of a trade which is of world wide importance; and the
steamers and launches of the Amazon tributaries are already as busy as
ever fulfilling the requirements of the rubber shippers in this vast
region. The exports of rubber now amount annually to thousands of tons,
valued at upward of five million dollars, nearly all of which passes
through the ports of Mollendo and Iquitos, the latter the capital of the
great rubber-producing territory of Loreto.

                             CHAPTER XXXII
             IQUITOS, THE CHIEF PERUVIAN PORT OF THE AMAZON


[Illustration: HOSPITALITY IN THE RUBBER COUNTRY.]

All the commerce of the Department of Loreto passes through its capital,
Iquitos, which is the chief port of the Amazon in Peru, and is one of
the important rubber-exporting centres of the world. It is a city of
about twenty-five thousand inhabitants, and is situated on the left bank
of the great river, over two thousand miles from its mouth and a few
leagues below the confluence of the Marañon with the Ucayali. Iquitos
overlooks a broad expanse of water, more like an inland sea than a
stream, the channel at this point being nearly three miles wide; in
front of the city lies a large island. The depth of the river makes it
possible for ocean steamers to anchor in the port, which has an average
of twenty-five feet of water, and, in summer, when the rainy season is
at its height, has twice that depth.

Not only does all the commerce of Loreto pass through Iquitos, but the
largest share of the imports and exports of the entire region of the
upper Amazon is distributed from this point. Merchandise for the rubber
camps is brought up the Amazon from foreign ports to Iquitos and is here
reshipped on smaller river steamers to the various interior towns along
the tributaries of the upper Amazon,—ports of the Ucayali, Huallaga,
Pastaza, Morona,—from which they are again reshipped in launches and
canoes to towns on the smaller branches of these waterways. Sometimes
the river boats carry enterprising explorers, gold hunters, rubber
gatherers, and commercial travellers in a strangely mixed company, with
usually but one idea in common—the prospect of fulfilling long-cherished
dreams. Material for adventure, romance, and scholarship is mingled in
the characters that one sees on such a trip, conversation on board
bringing out the most unexpected revelations.

Several steamship lines make regular trips between Iquitos and European
and North American ports. The Booth Steamship Company has been engaged
in this trade for some years, and has a line of commodious steamers for
carrying passengers and cargo. Bi-monthly trips are made from England,
returning by way of the United States, and _vice versa_, calling at Pará
and Manaos en route. This company recently built its own docks at
Iquitos, and other improvements are under consideration which will
greatly benefit the interests of trade in this port. The Red Cross Line
has monthly steamers to Iquitos; and a number of Peruvian merchants have
smaller fleets on the rivers from Iquitos to the interior. The
_Liberal_, a trim little steamer of a hundred and fifty tons, with a
speed of ten miles an hour, is one of the best of these river boats; it
is of modern construction, is lighted by electricity and is provided
with excellent accommodations for a limited number of passengers.

[Illustration: THE BOOTH PIER, IQUITOS.]

Iquitos is quite cosmopolitan, its population including representatives
of many nations; North American and European importers have branch
houses here, and the growing prosperity of the city has attracted
enterprising merchants from other parts of Peru and from neighboring
republics. The climate is healthful and not so oppressive as one might
suppose, considering the locality, less than four degrees south of the
equator and only a hundred and fifty feet above the level of the river.
It represents the aspect of a growing commercial centre with its new
wharves, warehouses and modern buildings that are rapidly replacing the
straw-thatched cottages and comfortless _chozas_, or huts, which were
features of the town a dozen years ago. Brick and iron are now largely
used in the construction of buildings, the roofs being of zinc or tiles.
The government house, the municipal chambers, churches, hospital, and
other public edifices, reflect the spirit of progress which is beginning
to animate the people. A flourishing Chamber of Commerce gives further
evidence of local enterprise. The city is surrounded by thick _bosques_,
or woods, in which every variety of vegetation abounds, and tropical
foliage is riotous in color and luxuriance. The frequent and heavy rains
of the summer season keep the verdure fresh and beautiful, though it is
a welcome relief to the inhabitants when winter comes and with it a
lessening of the heavy rainfall. In reality, very little change may be
noted in the thermometer, which averages from eighty-five to ninety
degrees Fahrenheit, all the year round.

[Illustration: ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL STREETS OF IQUITOS.]

[Illustration: CALLE DE MORONA, IQUITOS.]

The development of commercial traffic through the port of Iquitos may be
judged by a comparison of the trade of 1907 with that of preceding
years, the total duties on exports and imports of last year amounting to
nearly three hundred thousand pounds sterling, while those of the
previous year reached less than two hundred thousand pounds sterling,
and in 1895 the custom house receipts of this port did not exceed one
hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling. This rapid growth of trade
signifies that the region of the Montaña, particularly the Department of
Loreto, has been developing resources heretofore unexploited; and, when
the further possibilities of industrial activity in this part of Peru
are considered, the prospect for its future wealth appears very bright.

[Illustration: RIVER SCENE NEAR IQUITOS.]

The Department of Loreto includes the provinces of Alto Amazonas, Bajo
Amazonas, and Ucayali. At the time of the Independence, all this vast
territory belonged to the Intendencia of Trujillo, and was known as the
province of Mainas; it was made a province of the Department of La
Libertad, and, later, of Amazonas, until, in 1853, the Littoral Province
of Loreto was formed, with the city of Moyobamba as its capital. A few
years afterward, President Castilla raised the province to the dignity
of a maritime military department, with jurisdiction over all the Amazon
region bordering on the neighboring republics. At that time the
department consisted of the provinces of Moyobamba, Huallaga, Alto and
Bajo Amazonas; Huallaga was divided later to form the province of San
Martin, from which the present province of Ucayali was separated a few
years ago. The creation of the new Department of San Martin in 1905 took
from Loreto the provinces of Moyobamba, Huallaga, and San Martin, though
this still remains the largest political division of Peru, covering an
area of more than a hundred thousand square miles, according to Peruvian
claims.

[Illustration: A VIEW OF IQUITOS FROM THE RIVER.]

The provinces of Loreto are completely watered by the tributaries of the
Amazon; the main stream, under the name of Marañon, crosses Alto and
Bajo Amazonas through a territory of the greatest fertility, rich in
rubber, hardwoods, and tropical fruits; and along the eastern border of
Ucayali province, the river of the same name flows in a serpentine
course northward, receiving innumerable small streams that descend the
western slope of the central Cordilleras. The popular route from the
Pacific Coast to the forests of Loreto is by the Ucayali River to its
confluence with the Marañon, and thence along the great waterway down to
Iquitos; though a very interesting journey may be made by the northern
route, through Cajamarca, Chachapoyas and Moyobamba to the port of
Yurimaguas on the Huallaga River. Along both routes the luxuriance of
the Montaña is seen in all its glory; the forest is aglow with the
brilliant hues of a thousand birds and butterflies; the trees are alive
with chattering monkeys that swing back and forth by the long parasitic
vines which hang like ropes from the highest branches. In the heart of
the Montaña the trees become larger, the palms and ferns of denser
growth, and the creeping vines form a network about the overarching
boughs. Plantations of cacao, plantains, yucca, and other products
appear from time to time as a clear space separates the wooded tracts;
and, in the neighborhood of the great rivers, the _jebe_ and _caucho_
gatherers may be seen working their way through the _estradas_, or
journeying to some point on the river to take a boat down to Iquitos,
the metropolis of the rubber country. The sentiment of hospitality
prevails everywhere, and a traveller is usually treated with the
greatest kindness when he arrives at a settlement in the Amazon forest,
whatever his business or nationality. The men whose tasks keep them
buried for years in the heart of the rubber country are always glad to
have news from the outside world.

In the development of trade on the Amazon, the port of Iquitos has been
placed in direct communication with the head of navigation on all the
large tributaries of the great river, and explorations have been made
far up the smaller streams toward their source in the Cordilleras. The
expeditions sent out by the Peruvian government with this object in view
have added many interesting contributions to the knowledge already
existing in reference to the resources and wealth of Loreto and the
promising future of its chief port.

                             CHAPTER XXXIII
           NAVIGATION AND EXPLORATION ON THE AMAZON WATERWAYS


[Illustration: AN ENGINEERS’ CAMP AT PUERTO BERMUDEZ ON THE PICHIS
RIVER.]

Large steamers ascend the Amazon for three thousand miles, passing the
boundary line between Brazil and Peru at the port of Tabatinga and
continuing beyond Iquitos for hundreds of miles up the Marañon and the
Ucayali, Huallaga, or other tributaries. Yurimaguas, which is the most
important port on the Huallaga, five hundred miles above Iquitos, is
connected with the latter by a regular service of steamers of four
hundred tons, nearly all the trade of the Departments of San Martin and
Amazonas passing over this route. On the Ucayali are the commercial
ports of Contamina and Masisea, the latter noted as the first station in
the Montaña of the wireless telegraph system that connects Puerto
Bermudez with the port of Iquitos. Steamers of four hundred tons ply
between Iquitos and Contamina, seven hundred miles up the river; and,
during the rainy season when the waterways are deeper than at other
times, they ascend as far as Masisea, two hundred miles beyond
Contamina. From Masisea, steam launches convey passengers and cargo up
the Pachitea for two hundred miles to the Pichis—which unites with the
Palcazu to form the Pachitea—and along the Pichis for about a hundred
miles to the port of Bermudez, at the head of navigation on this branch
of the Ucayali and the point of embarkation for travellers between Lima
and Iquitos over what is known as the Central Route.

The length of time required to make the journey between Lima and Iquitos
varies greatly according to the season and the condition of the rivers,
the voyages up the water courses taking much longer than the descent.
The trip may be made, under favorable circumstances, in fifteen or
sixteen days. An interesting description of this trip, given in a recent
report of one of the Peruvian government engineers, shows the kind of
travelling one experiences in the Montaña and affords valuable
information as to the equipment necessary for such a journey. As the
route lies first across the Cordilleras, and the railway takes one only
from Lima to Oroya, where it is necessary to take mules for the ride
across the _puna_ and down the eastern slope to the river, passengers
are advised not to carry bulky luggage, about a hundred pounds being the
heaviest that any single piece should weigh; the same rule applies in
all mountainous regions where the path is narrow and pack-mules are the
freight carriers. It is also recommended that trunks, bags, and
everything holding perishable effects, be wrapped in waterproof
material, as rain falls daily and in a deluge throughout the region of
the lower Montaña.

But, if the traveller goes well equipped and prepared to make the best
of an experience that has its agreeable features as well as its
discomforts, the journey is likely to prove most interesting. One should
be provided with an army cot, a _mosquitero_, or netting, as a
protection from the prevailing pest of some sections of the river
course, a waterproof coat and cap, and a small medicine case containing
quinine, antiseptics, and ammonia. This precaution is advised as a
general rule, and it does not mean that medicine is sure to be needed,
nor that mosquitoes will torment the passenger throughout the entire
journey. As has been said elsewhere, the railway trip from Lima to Oroya
may be made in a day. After spending a night at Oroya, the traveller
proceeds on muleback to Tarma, about twenty miles away, over a road that
gives an excellent idea of Andean highways; the sturdy mules bred in
these altitudes are the only safe animals for such a journey, which is a
succession of steep ascents and narrow curves until the highest point is
reached, after which the downward road begins, as hazardous and
uncomfortable as the other. As the railway is nearly finished between
Oroya and Tarma, this part of the trip will soon be made under less
trying conditions. At present, it requires five or six hours to cover
these twenty miles. From Tarma to the Pichis River, the road is less
difficult, and, after passing Huacapistana, twenty-five miles northeast
of Tarma, the region of the Montaña is soon reached, the traveller being
then obliged to discard the heavy wraps required during the ride across
the high sierras, and to put on summer clothing.

The third day’s ride brings one to La Merced, on the banks of the
Chanchamayo River. This part of the journey is made over a fairly good
road, the distance from Huacapistana to La Merced, about twenty miles,
being covered easily in five hours. _Puentes colgantes_, or suspension
bridges, cross the Tarma and other rivers of this region, the route to
La Merced crossing at least half a dozen of these primitive-looking, but
generally serviceable, structures. La Merced is situated at an altitude
of about three thousand feet above sea level, and belongs to what may be
called the upper Montaña, to distinguish it from the region of the
plains, or the lower Montaña. The road from La Merced to Yapaz, a
distance of thirty miles, may be travelled in one day, though many
prefer to stop midway, at Pueblo Pardo, to break the journey, which is
more fatiguing as the rains become heavier, soaking the ground and
making progress difficult. But one learns to take life very leisurely in
the tropics, and it is pleasanter to jog along for a few hours, enjoying
the charm of the forest with its impressive silence, and resting when so
inclined, than to make an extra effort to accomplish in one day what may
be done just as well in two. If “Poor Richard” had lived in the
Chanchamayo valley, he would probably have reversed his advice to read:
“Never do to-day what you can put off till to-morrow.” A short distance
beyond Pueblo Pardo, the Camino de Pichis, as the road to the river is
called, crosses a suspension bridge over the Paucartambo River, built by
the English colony of the Perené, whose haciendas may be seen at
intervals between Pueblo Pardo and Yapaz.

[Illustration: THE CONFLUENCE OF THE CHUCHURAL AND PALCAZU RIVERS.]

From Yapaz to Enenas, eighteen miles, is another day’s journey, of five
or six hours; from Enenas to Porvenir, twenty-seven miles, the ride is
so fatiguing and difficult that it usually requires nine or ten hours to
cover the distance. This part of the journey leads the traveller through
the heart of the Montaña; and during the eighth day’s ride, which takes
one from Porvenir to San Nicolas, not a single house is seen, nor any
sign of human habitation. From Yapaz to San Nicolas, the climate is cool
and pleasant, but, after passing the Azupizu River ten miles below, the
heat becomes uncomfortable. Two days’ journey from San Nicolas is still
required to bring one to the river Pichis, which is reached at a point
called Puerto Yessup, where a canoe is in waiting to convey passengers
to Puerto Bermudez. The muleback trip need not take more than ten days
under ordinary circumstances. Most of the tambos, or lodging places,
along the route from Oroya to Puerto Bermudez, have telephone connection
with each other; and telegraphic stations are established at Oroya,
Tarma, La Merced, Enenas, Puerto Bermudez and other points. The railway
will be completed to Puerto Bermudez within a short time, and then the
trip overland to Iquitos will be a question of days instead of weeks, as
at present. A steamer makes the voyage from Puerto Bermudez to the port
of Iquitos in five or six days, calling at Masisea and other ports en
route.

[Illustration: PUERTO CLEMENT.]

The northern route from the coast to Iquitos has two starting points,
and reaches the upper Amazon at two separate ports. The route most
generally taken is that from Pacasmayo, _via_ Cajamarca, Chachapoyas and
Moyobamba to Yurimaguas; though the new railway will extend from Paita
to Puerto Limon, on the Marañon, with a branch to Yurimaguas.
Explorations have been made throughout this region, and reports have
been sent to the government dealing with the question of railway
building and road making in this part of the republic. The European
explorer Zaham, who travelled from Lima to Iquitos by way of Moyobamba
recently, wrote an enthusiastic letter in praise of this region, saying:
“In no country of the world have I seen a more fertile land or a more
suave and enchanting climate: nowhere have I seen such a variety of
fruits, nor a more exuberant vegetation: wheat, maize, rice, sugar-cane,
cacao, coffee, potatoes, and coca, equal to the products found in any
other part of the globe, and the silkworm flourishing, as I have seen
for myself.” The same writer adds that the only need of this region is
good roads and colonists. The government is doing all in its power to
secure both these advantages.

[Illustration: FORDING THE INAMBARI RIVER.]

The navigation of the vast river system of the Montaña is a question
that bears directly on the two important problems of transportation and
immigration. It has been proved in the history of both North and South
America that the tide of immigration is ever borne toward the sections
of country traversed by railways or reached by steamers; and it is
important that means of transportation should be guaranteed to colonists
before they establish themselves in a new country. With this object in
view, the Peruvian government is employing commissions to explore and
examine rivers that have hitherto been known only as a name, and the
results are most satisfactory. Voyages of discovery have been made up
the main stream and branches of the Yurúa, Purús, Putumayo, Napo, Tigre,
Morona, Pastaza, and others, and valuable knowledge has been gained
regarding these waterways. Along all the rivers of the Amazon system on
which lines of steamers and small craft are maintained, improvements
have been inaugurated with a view to facilitating transportation so that
more rapid and regular service may be secured. Merchant steamers,
engaged in the rubber trade, and in the shipment of products from the
forests of northern Cuzco to Iquitos and foreign ports, can ascend the
main stream of the Ucayali for three hundred miles above the mouth of
the Pachitea, and beyond the confluence of its great tributaries, the
Tambo and the Urubamba, continuing along the latter river for another
hundred miles until they reach the port of Mishagua, in the Department
of Cuzco. A line of railway is projected from the city of Cuzco to this
port, in accordance with the general plan of commercial development
which the Peruvian government has adopted.

The port of Mishagua lies at the mouth of the Mishagua River, which,
with its tributary, the Sarjali, is navigable for canoes for a distance
of more than two hundred miles, to what is known as the portage of
Fitzcarrald, a narrow isthmus across which the rubber shippers have made
a path through the forest to the headwaters of the Madre de Dios. This
important affluent of the Amazon’s mightiest tributary, the Madeira, has
its rise very near the source of the Purús, another of the Amazon’s
great branches. About twenty miles from its source, the Madre de Dios,
known by the name of the Manu, is navigable for steam launches; and
below its continence with the Pilcopata, where it takes the name of the
Madre de Dios, merchant steamers of five hundred tons serve the purposes
of transportation. If the channels of these rivers were dredged and
cleared of obstructions, it would be possible to navigate them all the
year round, in the dry as well as the wet season.

Under existing conditions, the extent of the Amazon waterways in Peru
that are navigable all the year round,—including the main stream, which
is navigable for four hundred miles above Tabatinga for vessels drawing
twenty feet of water,—is estimated at over five thousand miles. Of this
mileage, about one-third is navigable for steamers drawing from four to
eight feet of water, and the remainder for lighter steamers, not
requiring more than from two to four feet of depth for navigation. At
high water, the river transportation facilities cover an extent of ten
thousand miles for steamers, and about thirty thousand miles for light
craft such as canoes and rafts, which penetrate the immense forests of
the Montaña in every direction, along innumerable streams that feed the
mighty current of the main waterway from a thousand sources.

                             CHAPTER XXXIV
         FOREIGN INTERESTS IN PERU—IMMIGRATION AND COLONIZATION


[Illustration: COLONISTS OF THE SIERRA.]

The amount of foreign capital invested in Peru runs far into the
millions. North Americans have led in the successful inauguration of
large foreign enterprises, though English, German, Italian, and other
European nations are represented among the owners of industrial and
commercial establishments of increasing importance. During the year
1907, thirty new enterprises were initiated by Peruvian and foreign
syndicates for the exploitation of the national products, two-thirds of
the number being devoted to the development of the mining and rubber
interests of the country. Several existing companies augmented their
capital and enlarged the scope of their establishments, looking forward
to an increase in their business as a consequence of the improving of
facilities for transportation now in progress.

The most important British interests in Peru are in the hands of the
Peruvian Corporation, which, as elsewhere stated, has the control of the
principal railways and of a large share of the guano production for a
term of years, in accordance with their contract with the Peruvian
government. This powerful syndicate is interested also in colonization
in Peru, having established a foreign settlement on the banks of the
Perené River, in the valley of Chanchamayo, where the corporation owns
three million acres of land, ceded to it by the Peruvian government for
the purpose of colonization. The Perené colony was founded in 1892, a
hundred Italian immigrants being brought over under contract to clear
the land and cultivate it, to build roads, put up necessary dwellings,
and establish their homes there. They were, at first, maintained at the
cost of the Peruvian Corporation and received wages for their labor,
being at no expense for utensils, materials, etc., which were supplied
by the company. But as this support was gradually withdrawn, the
colonists became dissatisfied and many of them abandoned the settlement;
so that, five years later not more than half a dozen of the original
hundred remained. The colony has since grown and flourished, however,
its coffee plantations now extending over a large area and yielding a
valuable harvest annually. Besides coffee, the colonists of the Perené
also cultivate sugar, cocoa, and other products of the Montaña.

German interests in Peru are almost entirely of a commercial character,
though German colonists have taken up land in the Chanchamayo and other
valleys of the interior, and are engaged in agriculture. The first
German colony in Peru was founded in 1858, at Pozuzo, near Puerto Mairo,
in the department of Huánuco, on a branch of the Pachitea River. It now
numbers about a thousand, many of the original immigrants having
separated from the parent colony in 1891, to form a new settlement at
Oxapampa, in the Department of Junín, midway between Pozuzo and Cerro de
Pasco. Both the Pozuzo and Oxapampa colonies have grown, and the latter
has become very prosperous. “Oxapampa” means “a plain covered with
pastures,” and the name is well applied to this district, on which the
flocks and herds of the colonists increase rapidly and thrive with
moderate care. The people of Oxapampa cultivate everything that they
require, and are able to provide themselves with food, clothing, and
shelter from the products of their forests, pastures, and plantations.
The settlement is located on the margin of a river, a branch of the
Chorobamba, which feeds one of the numerous tributaries of the Pachitea.
Situated on the lowest slope of the oriental chain of the Cordilleras,
where the region of the forest begins, its resources include those of
both the semi-tropical and the tropical zones. Sugar, tobacco, yucca,
and plantains grow on its plantations. The colonists’ houses are built
of wood, and the sharp spikes of a native palm, the Batrix ciliata, are
used as nails for fastening the boards together. Some of the haciendas
of the colony have established sugar mills and manufacture _aguardente_,
literally “fire-water.” Others supply Cerro de Pasco and neighboring
towns with butter and lard. Cigars of a good quality are made in the
colony. The most urgent need of these people seems to be a better
opportunity for education and more facilities for travelling.

The Italians have been very successful colonists in all parts of South
America. In Brazil and Argentina they have become an important factor in
the development of industry and commerce, and in Peru they have
established successful enterprises of various kinds. Formerly the great
tide of Italian emigration was toward the United States, but of recent
years Italians have been finding their way to Brazil, Argentina, and
other Latin-American countries in increasing numbers. Peru has been too
remote from the transatlantic ports to secure a large proportion of the
immigration to South America, and its foreign population does not
approach that of the republics on the Atlantic seaboard; neither has
Peru sought to introduce great throngs of immigrants without considering
their desirability as citizens; the result is that those who have come
to the country are thrifty and industrious, a real acquisition to the
industrial population. The last census, taken in 1900, places the number
of Italian residents in Peru at ten thousand, but it is certain that the
census now in preparation will show a notable increase, as the
Department of Lima alone has more than five thousand Italians among its
residents.

[Illustration: IN THE HEART OF THE MINING REGION.]

The Italians have shown both initiative and energy in their various
enterprises in the republic. They are identified with some of the most
important improvements made in the capital and in Callao, besides which
they have established large factories in several cities. In the southern
coast region, the Italians are the chief owners of the olive groves and
other fruit orchards. In the city of Lima their bank and insurance
company are important institutions of credit. The capital owned by
Italians and employed in industrial and commercial enterprises in Peru
is estimated at about thirty million dollars, gold.

[Illustration: A FOREIGN COLONY IN THE RUBBER COUNTRY.]

The Department of Loreto is a promising territory for colonization. As
it lies entirely within the region of the Montaña and directly over the
equator, it is generally supposed to be a land of fevers and other
tropical diseases; but Colonel Palacios Mendiburu, who has travelled
throughout this part of the republic and has spent much time in studying
its conditions, says there are three points, “and only three,” in the
entire Department of Loreto in which malarial fever, known as
_paludismo_, is prevalent. These malarial districts are: San Antonio, on
the Marañon; between the mouth of the Pastaza and that of the
Cahuapanas; and along the Yavary and the Tigre Rivers. The humidity of
the atmosphere and the intensity of the heat have a debilitating effect
in the lower plains, and anemia frequently attacks the over-energetic
and those addicted to alcoholic stimulants. But the tales of terrible
diseases, attacks from cobras and boa-constrictors, as well as other
sensational experiences reported to be everyday occurrences in the
Montaña, are woven chiefly of the fabric of fancy. Colonel Palacios says
that the serpents and other poisonous creatures of the forest flee from
man; though he explains that it is advisable to travel always with one
or more companions, as a person alone is likely to meet with
disagreeable encounters in the _bosque_, where jaguars abound. The
natives of the forest find abundant game in this region; a successful
hunter will bring home a variety of meats, the monkey providing a
favorite dish. Fish are found in all the rivers, and turtles are
abundant in many localities. For a more vegetarian diet, the Montaña
supplies plenty of cocoa, the tree of which grows wild here; and the
bread-tree, the papaya, the pineapple and other tropical fruits are
found everywhere. Cotton grows wild, totally neglected in this remote
region.

[Illustration: A FERTILE VALLEY FOR COLONIZATION IN THE APURIMAC
REGION.]

According to the recent land law, especially designed to cover the
region of the Montaña, presented to the senate by the representatives of
Loreto in 1907, the state lands of this territory may be ceded to
individuals for exploitation and profit by sale, denouncement,
adjudication, or contract. When ceded by sale, the price is five sols
per hectare (two and a half acres), in consideration of which the
purchaser acquires perpetual and irrevocable possession of the lands,
the proprietorship of the trees found thereon, etc. Not more than five
hundred hectares can be sold to the same person without legislative
authorization. If, after ten years, the purchaser has not at least
one-tenth of his land under exploitation, it becomes again the property
of the state; but if, in addition to satisfying this obligation, the
owner has planted rubber trees, he receives a premium from the
government.

By denouncement, lands in the Montaña may be acquired as concessions
from the government, not to exceed a thousand _pertenencias_, the
_pertenencia_ for this class of property being a hundred hectares (two
hundred and fifty acres). In case a concession of more than a thousand
acres is asked, the granting of it depends on Congress. As elsewhere
stated, a half-yearly tax of two sols and fifty centavos (one dollar and
twenty-five cents, gold) is levied on each _pertenencia_.

The government may concede lands by adjudication gratuitously, up to
five hectares for each person, with the obligation to cultivate, within
three years, at least the fifth part of the land granted. Failing to
fulfil this demand, the colonist loses his claim. The concession of
lands in the Montaña may be made by the government in the interests of
public works, such as road-building, etc., or for purposes of
colonization on a large scale, as has been done in the case of the Inca
Mining Company and other enterprises. The funds arising from the taxes
on adjudicated lands are employed in the improvement of highways and in
the payment of premiums to the cultivators of rubber trees.

The government desires to bring into the country a good class of foreign
labor, and facilities are granted to colonists who come of their own
accord to settle here, especially to those who establish themselves in
the Chanchamayo valley and other regions of the Montaña. Two hectares of
land are granted free to each person, and his passage is paid from the
port of Callao to Oroya by railway, and beyond that point to his
destination by muleback; a monthly subsidy is also granted for a year,
consisting of three pounds sterling to each family, and one pound to
each individual without a family, the first quarterly allowance being
paid in advance.

It is recognized by all the countries of America that only by increasing
their population through immigration can their territories be developed
and made to yield the riches which a beneficent creator meant they
should. As the Argentine statesman Alberdi wrote, more than half a
century ago: “To populate is to civilize. Bring immigrants to make of
them good Argentinos.—Bring colonists, not to be exploited by the
capitalist class, but that they may here set up their domestic hearth,
and live among us as one of ourselves. The laws should amply favor these
new brethren of ours who come to earn their living by the sweat of their
brows, and they should have ample liberty, if they wish to fix their
permanent residence in the country and to contribute to the development
of the nation.”

                              CHAPTER XXXV
       FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL PROGRESS—MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES


[Illustration: AN INDIAN WEAVING THE PONCHO.]

Few countries have been visited by such great extremes of fortune as
Peru, at one time reckoned among the richest in the world and at another
accounted so poor as to be bordering on bankruptcy. The history of
Peruvian finances is a record of alternate prodigality and economy, of
expensive experiments, abounding resourcefulness, and, through all its
phases, of unlimited faith and resolute optimism. When, with the
proclamation of independence, Peru threw off the yoke of Spain, its
revenues did not exceed two million dollars. In order to maintain the
struggle it was necessary to raise a loan, especially as a large share
of the national income was still under the control of the royalists.
This loan, which was made in London in 1822 for the sum of one million
two hundred thousand pounds sterling at six per cent interest (three
years’ interest was deducted from the principal, of which only a part
was handed over in cash, the rest being delivered in weapons and
ammunition of war), was supplemented three years later by a second loan
for a smaller amount at the same rate of interest. Added to this debt
were large sums in recognition of the assistance rendered by Chile and
Colombia in the war of Independence, all of which contributed to bring
the foreign debt of Peru up to about four million pounds sterling at the
very outset of the national career as a republic. The total value of the
exports at that time did not amount to two million pounds sterling, and
the custom house receipts were less than two hundred thousand pounds
sterling, the remainder of the revenue being chiefly derived from a
contribution levied in place of the tax which Spain had imposed on the
Indians.

Within fifteen years after the inauguration of the republic, the custom
house receipts had more than doubled, and a few years later the
production of guano began to yield such enormous returns that the
country appeared to be once more prepared to hold its own among the most
prosperous nations of the world. In 1850, the loans of 1822 and 1825
were cancelled by means of a new loan in London for three million eight
hundred thousand pounds sterling, and in the same year the internal debt
was consolidated in bonds bearing three per cent interest, to the amount
of a million pounds sterling. Including the debt to Chile and the
floating debt, Peru then owed only about six million pounds sterling,
while the revenue from guano alone was a million pounds sterling a year.
But, as has been shown elsewhere, the rapid acquisition of wealth from
the guano trade brought with it the temptation to reckless expenditure,
to which the unsettled politics of the country contributed in great
measure. The internal debt increased four million pounds sterling in
five years, and each succeeding estimate of the budget showed heavier
expenditures for the government service. At the same time, many
improvements were inaugurated which necessitated the outlay of large
sums.

During General Castilla’s administration, the Peruvian monetary
system,—which had become demoralized after the Peru-Bolivian
Confederation by the circulation, at par, of Bolivian silver money of a
lower standard than the national currency,—was reformed through the
conversion of all inferior Bolivian coins in exchange for those of Peru,
up to the amount of ten million dollars and the prohibition of any
future use of the depreciated coin. The new law established the decimal
system and the double standard of gold and silver, the silver sol, worth
a dollar, being recognized as the monetary unit; though the gold coinage
of that period lasted only a few years, being abolished in a later
administration. In order to carry out the currency reform, and to
consolidate the foreign debt, Peru borrowed, in 1862, in London, five
and a half million pounds sterling, at four and a half per cent interest
and eight per cent yearly amortization, the loan being issued at
ninety-three per cent. All the government revenues and also the receipts
from guano sales in England and Belgium were pledged as a guarantee of
this loan. The seizure of the Chincha Islands by Spanish men-of-war in
1864 made it obligatory for Peru to build a navy strong enough to drive
back the invaders, and, with this object in view, a new loan of ten
million pounds sterling was made in London. The ironclads _Huascar_ and
_Independencia_ were built with the proceeds, part of which were further
employed in the construction of the railway from Mollendo to Arequipa.

A few far-seeing statesmen early recognized the necessity for
establishing a more satisfactory economic régime than that which
governed Peru at this time, and, during the administration of the
Dictator Prado, his Finance Minister, Don Manuel Pardo, inaugurated a
new fiscal system. By means of taxation on certain luxuries and the
levying of an export duty of three per cent on the chief national
products, the government receipts were considerably increased, and it
was hoped that, as the system developed, it would create an important
revenue aside from that produced by guano, which, it was realized, was
an uncertain quantity and mortgaged almost to the limit of its financial
value. Unfortunately, the succeeding administration did not pursue the
same policy, and new loans were made, which brought the foreign debt up
to thirty-three million pounds sterling, the government being obliged to
pay for the use of this loan two million seven hundred thousand pounds
sterling annually. The entire yearly revenue from guano was not more
than two million pounds sterling, and the national credit went down
under the strain of the tremendous obligations imposed on it.

When President Manuel Pardo was called to the chief executive office in
1872, he made a heroic effort to improve the financial condition, which
was one of internal as well as external disorder. The budget of 1873 for
ordinary expenses had been raised to nearly twenty-two million sols (at
forty pence), and a heavy debt of more than that amount was found to be
owing by the custom house and other government offices for credits
recognized and ordered to be paid during the previous period of
prosperity. Nine million sols were still due on railroad construction,
and a suspension of this important work was threatened. Added to these
discouraging features of the situation was the rapid increase in the
production of nitrate, which was becoming a formidable rival to guano,
being prepared and exported free, while the latter was exported for the
account of the State and was the source from which three-fourths of the
funds for the national expenditure were derived. President Pardo reduced
the estimate of the home budget to seventeen million sols, as it had
stood in 1871 and sought, by the only available means, to raise
extraordinary funds sufficient to prevent the disaster of a suspension
of the much-needed railroad construction. But the remedy was applied too
late, and all his efforts were defeated by circumstances which would not
have arisen under normal conditions. The president was obliged to borrow
large sums from the banks, which, under the laws then in force, might
issue notes payable to bearer at sight for three times the amount of
currency they had in hand. The merchants, led by the fictitious
prosperity founded on a flattering but burdensome credit, had given far
too great expansion to their trade, and now that they were unable longer
to use drafts corresponding to the value of guano when making foreign
payments, they were obliged to export coin, which was done until the
supply was exhausted, only the banknotes remaining in circulation. As
the government was not in a position to meet its obligations to the
banks, which, in turn, were unable any longer to convert their notes
into currency, a commercial panic followed, in 1875, with the long list
of business failures that accompany such a dire event. The government
came to the rescue by granting the banks a moratorium, which would
enable them to get the necessary cash to resume the payment of their
obligations in currency; but the government was unable to give any
financial assistance and the required coin for payments in cash was not
forthcoming at the expiration of the moratorium. President Prado, who
succeeded President Manuel Pardo in 1877, arranged a new loan with the
banks, in consideration of which the state assumed the responsibility of
the entire emission of banknotes,—fixing the maximum at eighteen million
sols,—thus converting them into government notes, and establishing the
use of paper money. The war with Chile followed in 1879, and proved the
culminating disaster. But, if the consequences of this war were
deplorable from an economic standpoint, the conditions which they
brought about tried the mettle of the nation and proved its strength.
Plunged from wealth into poverty within a few years, with its commerce
paralyzed, its industries at a standstill, nearly all the private wealth
as well as the national fortune swept away, Peru bent under the crushing
weight of accumulated evils. But, like tempered steel, the national
spirit could bend without being broken; and with every lightening of the
load the inherent strength of the people has shown itself, until,
to-day, its optimistic character is as dominant as ever.

[Illustration: THE LIMA SAVINGS BANK.]

[Illustration: THE BANCO POPULAR, LIMA.]

As soon as the war with Chile was ended by the treaty of Ancón in 1884,
Peru turned to the problem of restoring the national finances, and a few
years later the contract elsewhere referred to was arranged, whereby the
Peruvian Corporation assumed the foreign debt and agreed to complete the
construction of projected railways, in return for certain concessions
and privileges. The country began at once to recuperate, though slowly
at first, as might be supposed, the question of politics absorbing much
attention. Patriotic and capable leaders came forward, however, to meet
the occasion with judgment and foresight. One of the most important
reforms effected was the adoption of the gold standard, which has done a
great deal to attract foreign capital and to inspire confidence abroad.
The government notes that had been issued to meet the needs of war,
became so depreciated in value that they were little used and finally
they were practically withdrawn from circulation by the announcement
that their acceptance was optional; immediately the old coins—the silver
sols—began to reappear, imported from other Spanish-American republics,
especially Central American, where they formed at that time the
circulating medium; the government reopened the mint, and Peruvian
silver was coined into sols; at this juncture the depreciation of silver
arose, and the question of establishing a gold standard was debated. The
idea of adopting a gold standard grew in favor when a second fall in
silver occurred in 1886, adversely affecting the finances of all
countries that used the silver standard exclusively. President Pierola
gave a strong impulse to the proposed measure and Congress finally
sanctioned its adoption in 1897. The legal equivalent of the Peruvian
libra, or pound, was fixed at ten sols, which at once solved the problem
of the value of sols in circulation, amounting to about twelve million.
Then the free coinage of silver was suspended and reimportation of
silver sols was prohibited, though it was a legal tender in Peru.
Congress also passed a law by which custom house duties had to be paid
in gold, at the rate of one pound sterling for every ten sols, which
established the equivalent between the English sovereign and the silver
sols at the rate of one to ten. In December, 1897, a law was passed to
authorize the coinage of the libra, of the same weight and fineness as
the English sovereign, and ordering it to be received by the state as
the equivalent of ten sols. In 1901, it was declared by law that the
monetary unit in Peru was the Peruvian libra and that silver sols were a
legal tender up to the sum of only ten sols; and, two years later, all
the banks came to an agreement to keep their accounts and to perform all
their operations in the new legal money of Peru, the gold libra. The
success and facility with which this important monetary reform was
accomplished does credit to the genius of the financiers who projected
and carried it through.

The fiscal reports of the last ten years show that Peru has made
wonderful progress in the rehabilitation of the national finances and
the establishment of a system of revenue and expenditure which ensures
permanent and solid advancement. A very important share of the credit
for this financial progress is due to the newly elected President of
Peru, His Excellency Don Augusto Leguia, who, as Finance Minister in the
cabinets of President Candamo and President Pardo, gave signal proofs of
his superior financial and administrative gifts. Probably no other
country can show such a rapid increase of revenues due to the
administrative labors of one of its ministers as can Peru, whose fiscal
receipts were raised from twelve million to thirty million sols annually
during his term of office as Minister of Finance. The loan of six
million sols, recently contracted for the purpose of acquiring naval
elements, the creation of the bank of deposits and consignments and
other financial undertakings of great importance to the country have
been effected through his initiative and energy.

Every year shows an increase in the receipts and a decrease of
expenditures under the present government. In all departments of the
fiscal system, reforms have been inaugurated with a view to
strengthening the national finances; the National Company of
Collections, a joint stock company that was formed at the close of the
war with Chile to organize a system of taxation and to take charge of
the collections shows by its latest report that the receipts from taxes
increased more than a hundred thousand sols from the last half-year of
1906 to the same semester of 1907, the collection from July to December,
1907, amounting to two million one hundred and fifty thousand sols. The
interest on the internal debt of thirty-three million sols has been paid
to date; and the claim of the Guano Consignee Company of the United
States has been paid by an issue of fifteen million sols in bonds of the
public debt. The prosperity that has become apparent in all branches of
trade is indicated by the profits shown in the Peruvian Corporation’s
report for 1907, amounting to more than two million sols. The banking
institutions, which have been closely identified with the financial
fortunes of the government, have been particularly successful in their
negotiations during the past year. The bank of London and Peru has had
its securities quoted on the Paris Bourse, and has established a bank of
issue in Bolivia with a capital of two hundred thousand pounds; the
Banco Italiano and the Banco Popular have increased their capital,
besides adding large sums to their reserve funds; the German Bank has
installed branches in Callao, Arequipa, and Trujillo within the past two
years; and the savings banks and insurance companies have enlarged the
scope of their activities.

[Illustration: A NATIVE INDUSTRY OF THE COAST REGION.]

Commerce has felt the stimulus of progressive government, and commercial
enterprise has flourished notably within the past five years. In 1902
the imports amounted in value to three and a half million pounds, the
exports to three and three-quarter millions; in 1906, the value of the
national imports reached five million pounds sterling and the exports
amounted to six million pounds sterling in value. The first half of 1907
showed less trade returns than the corresponding semester of the
preceding year, but the commercial reports for the first half of the
year 1908 give an increase of one hundred and sixty-five thousand pounds
sterling over the total returns for the same period of 1907.

The only export duties charged in Peru are: a three per cent ad valorem
tax on gold in bullion or dust; a charge of forty cents per dozen on
“Panamá” hats exported from Paita; and a duty of twenty cents a
kilogram, gross, or twenty-four cents a kilogram, net, equivalent to
about four per cent ad valorem, on Pará rubber and caoutchouc. The
import duties are more numerous; wines and liquors, tea, coffee, butter,
cheese, and a few other products pay a duty of sixty-five per cent, and
there is a long list of articles on which a duty of from ten to twenty
per cent is charged; but all machinery which is used directly to favor
industrial development is entered free of duty, as are also books and
utensils for the purpose of public instruction.

[Illustration: A COCAINE FACTORY IN THE MONZON VALLEY.]

Foreign merchants have established themselves in all the larger towns of
Peru, and in the coast region they have built up very important
enterprises. The English merchants devote themselves especially to the
wholesale import and export trade, in which they have strong competitors
among the Germans. The French have change of a great deal of the retail
business, particularly in articles of luxury; and the Italians are the
principal purveyors of foreign wines, table delicacies, etc. The
Peruvian merchant has a share in all the trade and Peruvian salesmen
travel throughout the country selling to the merchants of the interior
the goods imported by the larger establishments of Lima and Callao. The
North Americans have established few business houses, but they control a
large share of the mining enterprises, and are financially interested in
the construction of railways and other public works of the country. Some
of the largest commercial and industrial establishments of the United
States send their agents to Peru. But North American trade is still in
the infancy of its development so far as the South American market is
concerned, few shippers in the United States knowing much about the
geography of the great southern continent. When, as has frequently
occurred, merchandise ordered for Lima is sent to Mollendo as the
nearest port, and goods for Arequipa are unloaded at Callao by the
shipper’s orders, it becomes apparent that the knowledge concerning
commercial routes south of the equator is decidedly limited among those
exporters who are already in the field, to say nothing of those who have
not yet entered it. But there is a growing interest among merchants of
the United States in the trade of South America, and every year shows an
increase in the correspondence directed to the Peruvian Consulate at New
York seeking information on this subject. The Consul-General, Hon.
Eduardo Higginson, brings large experience in the foreign service of his
country to the particular task which occupies him in the great
metropolis,—the promotion of commercial relations between the two
countries. The offices of the consulate are fitted up with all the
requisites of a consular bureau, and in its library may be found
literature relating to the industrial and commercial conditions of Peru.

It is impossible that the reciprocity of trade between Peru and the
United States should show any marked improvement until better facilities
can be secured for rapid and cheap transportation. But this is to be
accomplished by the inauguration of the new National Steamship Line,
which, next year, will cover the distance between Callao and Panamá in
four days, and, later, by the completion of the Panamá Canal. From 1902
to 1905 the imports from the United States were increased by twenty per
cent, while the exports to that country remained stationary, and in 1905
declined, owing to the special privileges granted by the northern
republic to Cuban sugars, with which Peru was unable to compete; in the
same period, the shipments have more than doubled from Peru to Great
Britain, where Peruvian sugars enter on equal terms with those of other
countries.

The National Assembly of Commerce is an institution of increasing
importance in Peru. Though recently organized, in 1905, it has already
done much to foster trade and to promote the commercial relations of the
country on a broad scale. When Secretary Root visited Lima, he was made
an honorary member of this organization, which works as a kind of
auxiliary of the Chambers of Commerce, as one of its founders described
it in his address to Mr. Root on that occasion, “to carry into practice
the formation of a world wide legislation which shall mark the courses
in which the inexhaustible current of industrial products ought to run.”
In most of the larger cities, chambers of commerce have been established
to promote not only the direct interests of trade, but also the
development of the national industries, with the success of which the
trade of the country is closely identified.

The encouragement and promotion of manufacturing industry is especially
desirable, and this field of enterprise offers exceptional opportunities
for investment. Like all other South American countries, Peru imports
many articles which could be profitably made at home and for which it
furnishes a large share of the raw material. But, until comparatively
recent years, few factories of importance existed in Peru, and most of
these date from the period when the fall in silver and the consequent
depreciation of the national currency made the importation of foreign
manufactured articles enormously expensive, and encouraged the
establishment of home enterprises to compete for this trade. During the
period of the viceroyalty, the home government prohibited manufacturing
in the colonies, in order to protect the commerce of the mother country;
and in the earlier days of the republic the conditions were not
favorable to the development of this branch of industry.

[Illustration: THE ITALIAN BANK, LIMA.]

The most important manufacturing enterprises are in the hands of the
Peruvians themselves, though Italians and other foreign colonists have
established large factories within the past few years. The manufacture
of cotton and woollen goods by the primitive process used among the
Indians to-day has been in vogue from time immemorial, but not until
nearly half a century ago, in 1861, were the first modern looms
introduced, for the woollen factory of Lucre, near Cuzco, which was
founded by Dr. Garmendia in 1860. The most modern establishment for the
manufacture of woollen goods is that of Marangani, also in the
neighborhood of Cuzco, founded in 1897, with Peruvian capital amounting
to five thousand pounds, which has since been increased to thirty
thousand pounds. The factory is now owned by the heirs of the founder,
the largest shareholder, Don J. W. Rodriguez del Carpio, being also the
manager of the enterprise. English, German, and Belgian machinery of the
most modern manufacture is used, the factory is lighted by electricity,
as are also the houses of the operatives. All the employés are native
workmen, and the managers of the various sections are also Peruvians,
except in one section, of which an Italian expert has charge. The
company provides free instruction for the children of employés, as well
as free medical attendance when required. Cashmeres, flannels, and fine
cloths are manufactured from native wool, chiefly that of the sheep,
though some alpaca is used. Only the dyes are imported, everything else
used in the factory being of native origin, and the dyes are chiefly
made from woods found in the Montaña. The Marangani establishment has
direct communication with Cuzco by telephone, and with all the cities of
the republic by telegraph. It is one of the most progressive and
up-to-date enterprises in South America. The largest cloth factory in
Peru is that of Santa Catalina, in Lima, which produces about a quarter
of a million yards of cashmere and cloths for the army, besides various
knitted goods. It gives work to between seven and eight thousand
employés and its business is increasing annually. There are only four or
five woollen factories in the republic, Arequipa having one of the
larger ones, and Lima another.

[Illustration: VESTIBULE OF THE BANK OF LONDON AND PERU, LIMA.]

The manufacture of cotton goods has progressed with remarkable success
since the establishment of the first cotton factory in 1874. Five large
and flourishing mills of this kind are now located in the environs of
Lima, besides several in other cities, of which the most important are
those of Arequipa and Ica. From these factories, Peru and Bolivia are
supplied with cotton materials, duck, drills, etc., and since their
advent, the importation of cotton cloth from Germany and England has
notably diminished. The annual output of Peruvian cotton factories is
about twenty-five million yards, the consumption of clean raw cotton
being from two to three thousand tons annually. The capital employed is
estimated at between four and five million sols. The Victoria cotton
factory of Lima is one of the most modern establishments of its kind in
Peru, and a visit to the various departments inspires one with
admiration for the systematic and orderly appearance of the place, as
well as the quality of the work done, which is equal to the best turned
out from similar factories in Europe and North America.

The silk industry is still in the experimental stage, so far as the
making of fabrics is concerned, though Lima has a practical school of
sericulture and the Department of Abancay is giving especial attention
to this branch of industry. The making of Panamá hats occupies a
considerable number of the population in Catacaos, Eten, and Moyobamba,
though there are no large establishments having charge of their
manufacture exclusively. For the preparation of cereal and other food
stuffs, several mills and factories have been opened in Lima and Callao.
The flour mills of the Santa Rosa Company and the biscuit factories,
fruit-preserving works, chocolate factories, etc., of these and other
cities employ modern machinery and are successful enterprises. Lima,
Callao, Arequipa, and Cuzco have large breweries and cigar factories,
the latter being also an industrial feature of the towns of Trujillo and
Piura.

Trujillo has, in addition to its other factories, extensive works for
the elaboration of cocaine. This drug has grown greatly in demand within
recent years, and is now prepared in twenty-five Peruvian factories,
some of them located in the region of the coca trees. The factory of
Monzon is among the most important of these enterprises. Peru produces
enough cocaine to meet the world’s demand, the annual output approaching
a hundred tons. It is remarkable that so few of the medicinal plants and
dyewoods of Peru are elaborated in native establishments. Sulphuric acid
could be produced at low cost, and there is a promising field for the
manufacture of dyes. Among the minor manufactures are paper, matches,
leather, cotton seed oil, lumber, ceramics, and similar useful articles
of universal necessity or artistic value.

The Santa Rosa works, inaugurated by the Associated Electric Companies
of Peru, or, as the syndicate is sometimes called, the “Electric Trust,”
is a manufacturing industry of the greatest importance. It is
established for the purpose of generating electricity for the entire
service of electric lighting and the system of railroads and street cars
in Lima, Callao, and Chorillos. The capital employed in this gigantic
enterprise is more than ten million dollars gold, and it is owned and
controlled by Peruvians. The offices of the company are located at Santa
Rosa, in the outskirts of Lima, and the central generating station is in
Chosica. This immense establishment is, to-day, capable of providing
fourteen thousand horse-power in motor force. Nearly all the electric
material for the enterprise was purchased in the United States. The
Associated Electric Companies represent the first appearance of the
modern “trust” in the Andean republic of the Pacific.

                             CHAPTER XXXVI
 THE PASSING OF THE OLD PERU—ITS LEGACY TO POSTERITY—THE DESTINY OF THE
                                NEW PERU


[Illustration: A QUICHUA MOTHER.]

The old Peru is passing,—the dominant traits of the nation are
changing,—new life is apparent in its ideals, its institutions, in the
spirit that rules society and politics, in everything that shows the
influence of a broader outlook, a greater range of endeavor, a loftier
aspiration. The traditions of caste and the contempt for utilitarian
ideals which constituted a part of the creed of the colonial aristocracy
have given place to an appreciation of true worth wherever found; the
worship of luxury and pleasure has ceased to hold in thrall a people
cradled in the pernicious atmosphere of a too abundant wealth, and the
discipline of suffering and loss has brought out the inherent strength
of a proud and gifted race; stimulated by the necessity of keeping up
with the march of modern progress in order that their country may
maintain the place to which its past history and present possibilities
entitle it, the Peruvians of to-day are putting forth determined and
well-defined efforts to overcome every obstacle in the path of their
highest development—and they are achieving phenomenal success.

But there is still much of the old Peru that it is to be hoped will long
remain. The picturesque charm which lingers about the ancient people of
the sierra, in their quaint costumes and primitive ways, has apparently
lost little by the advent of modern conditions; these children of a
fading past are as much attached to their time-honored dress and to
their traditional occupations as any Oriental, and it will be a long
time before a pronounced change in this particular is likely to take
place. During the colonial period the Indians were obliged to adopt some
features of the Spanish garb,—probably to please their Christian
masters,—and it is not known how long the process of transformation
required; but the present fashion of the Indians of Cuzco and other
localities of the sierra is a survival of the costume worn in the time
of the first Spanish Bourbon kings, while their jewels still show the
coat-of-arms of Charles V. Although there is no difference in dress to
distinguish the Indian in authority from his followers, the Alcalde of
the sierra is recognized as a very important personage among his fellows
by the silver-bound vara which he carries; it is the emblem of his
authority and is in his eyes more than a mere symbol; he will not part
with it for an instant and he would feel himself bereft of his power to
rule if it were taken away.

[Illustration: DESCENDANTS OF THE INCAS’ SUBJECTS.]

Though obedient to the Catholic faith, the Indians have their own
celebrations in addition to those of the church; they still observe the
feasts of the seedtime and harvest, as did their heathen ancestors,
though many features of the festivities as originally practised have
been eliminated. The tenacity with which they hold to their traditions
is seen in many things. When a new house is built, it is decorated with
flowers—a survival of the ceremonies held on such occasions in the days
of the Incas—and a party is invited to celebrate the event. Over the
doors of some old houses are symbols of both Incaic and Christian
worship, though this is not seen on the more recently built homes, the
roofs of which, with few exceptions, are adorned with a large tin cross,
about two feet high, having attached to it small copies of the various
instruments of torture used at the crucifixion of our Saviour, as well
as other reminders of that tragedy; the spear that pierced his side, the
long pole and sponge on which vinegar was given to quench his thirst,
the garment for which they cast lots, and even the cock that crowed when
Peter had thrice denied his master, are represented in conjunction with
the central emblem of Christianity. The domicile of a bridal couple is
easily distinguished by its being decorated with branches of totora
(bulrushes) which are kept in evidence for eight days and signify that
an invitation is extended to all friends to partake of the hospitality
of the newly married pair.

[Illustration: A TYPE OF THE AMAZON INDIAN.]

[Illustration: THE SCION OF A NOBLE FAMILY OF THE FOREST.]

The change from old to new conditions in Peru is a transition in which
the Indian has had little share; not because he is prevented, but
because of his disinclination to learn new ways and his lack of capacity
to receive and apply modern knowledge. It is impossible to say what may
be accomplished for future generations, but, judging from past history,
centuries are required to accustom the indigenes to any radical change,
and they seem utterly bewildered in the face of the rapid march of the
present-day civilization. They are not easily induced to use modern
tools in their work even when the superiority of such utensils is proved
to them. The effort which the Indian is obliged to make in order to grow
accustomed to the use of the modern implements is inconceivable to the
modern mind; to these ancient people, it is a herculean task to attempt
any new thing, and, if allowed to follow their own inclination, they
will gladly throw aside the “improved” plough and the light,
long-handled hoe, in favor of their tried and trusted though
old-fashioned and cumbersome tools. Spinning and weaving are favorite
occupations of the Indians of the coast as well as of the sierra, and
their primitive looms, on which blanket and lighter materials are made,
may be seen in most of their homes.

[Illustration: ALCALDES, WITH VARAS, THE INSIGNIA OF THEIR AUTHORITY.]

Not only in the descendants of the Incas’ subjects does the charm of the
past linger in many beautiful and interesting features of Peru to-day.
The influence of the viceroyalty is seen in some of the most attractive
characteristics of republican Peruvians; their inheritance from their
colonial ancestry may not be an unmixed blessing, but they have reason
to be proud of some of its advantages. The unanimous verdict of
travellers is that the Peruvians are a people of inherited refinement,
culture, and geniality, and that their capital is one of the most
delightful places in the world for a stranger to visit; their politeness
and courteous hospitality is a heritage from the viceroyalty,—and it is
more Peruvian than Spanish, being free from the extreme formality which
is the keynote of Spanish courtesy.

The new Peru is the result of a transition extending over a long period,
but of which the last steps have been rapid and of particular
significance. The heritage of aristocratic Spain held the republican
Peruvians in bondage long after the declaration of their independence
gave verbal freedom and equality to all. It was not possible that the
old ideas and tendencies should vanish with a stroke of the Liberator’s
pen. But the desire for liberty grew in the hearts of the people as its
blessings were ever more enjoyed and appreciated, and latent abilities
were awakened as the demand became imperative for capable, resolute, and
dominant leaders to advance in the path of progress. So long as fortune
smiled and wealth came easily, it was not possible that the best
characteristics of the people should be developed, however, and it was
not until adversity struck a heavy blow that the true spirit of the
nation was revealed.

[Illustration: AN INDIAN WOMAN OF LORETO.]

It is sometimes said that the Peruvians are too gentle for their own
good—that the national optimism is combined with too large a share of
“faith in a lucky star” to be conducive of determined effort. But the
history of the past few years proves that the nation is capable of
advancing in line with the most progressive countries, and that the
elements uniting to consolidate the best interests of the new Peru are
not only unlimited faith and confidence but also fine judgment,
well-directed energy, and established principles. It is peculiarly
significant of the tendency of the new Peru that the statesman chosen to
govern its destinies during the next four years as president of the
republic is one of the most capable financiers in South American
politics. It is not because of his famous ancestry—he is a descendant of
the noble Estete who distinguished himself during the period of the
conquest and established the first settlement at Trujillo—nor yet for
his scholarship, though he is among the best informed men of his
country, but because he realizes, in his wonderful grasp of present-day
needs and possibilities, the aspirations of his people, and is prepared
to lead them to greater heights than the nation has yet known. The
president-elect has already announced the policy of his government,
which is to be an instrument of progress, its underlying impulses the
maintenance of peace and the protection of the interests and rights of
all citizens. Questions of sanitation, education, immigration,
agriculture, and railroad construction are to receive attention, and
everything that may contribute to the national well-being will have
careful consideration. The staunch principles of the man who is to
direct the destinies of his country for the next four years are voiced
in his declaration: “I intend to be the head of the nation, not the head
of a party.” This is the spirit of leadership demanded by the Peruvians
to-day. A new generation is taking the place of the older; new vitality
pulses through the veins of the younger patriot, and his nerves are
stronger, his sight is keener and his recognition of the forces that are
moulding the destinies of empires to-day is impelling him to more active
endeavor. That he does not forget the debt of honor due to the noble
heroes who have rendered the highest services to the country in the
past, while he recognizes the merit of those who are working for its
present and future aggrandizement, is shown by the liberality with which
monuments are built to commemorate their deeds. On the 8th of September
last, a magnificent pantheon was dedicated to the memory of “The
Defenders of the Nation in the War of 1879”; in its crypt repose the
remains of the immortal heroes Admiral Grau and Colonel Bolognesi. It is
the most imposing monument of the capital and shows that while the
national heart beats high with hope for future achievement, it is still
true to the sentiment of gratitude for compatriots who were sacrificed
in the darker days that are past. With one hand clasping the tender
memories of misfortune and the other extended to receive the blessings
of a more prosperous day, the Peruvian nation displays its most salient
characteristics, loyalty and optimism.

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE OLD AND THE NEW PERU ***


    

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
